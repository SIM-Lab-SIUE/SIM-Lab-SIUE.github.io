I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.

I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",2011-01-08 23:52:22

Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me.

It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  

I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.

My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?

I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.

The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.

After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",2010-03-13 22:33:10

The person who may clean the vehicle may be a thief. I left in the car my radar detector complete with a case not logged in to their lost and found. When I check in my rental on 12/21 and returned 01/02/2018 to visit the counter they told me nothing was found. They also told me that for something with a case go missing was very unlikely. Yet they found nothing. Hmmm, I wonder how it can go missing when it was the only place I left it? I filed a lost ticket with them; Reference Number: 4355421, Reported: 12/21/2017.

They may think their employees may be honest but my $300 radar detector is nowhere to be found at their location. So? Yes, one of their employee's stole it. 

I'm a fan of the concept of picking your car. As someone who has been using the same rental place in St. Louis Airport for 8 months and counting. I can tell you they do lousy job at cleaning the cars. I'm always finding plastic bottles underneath the back seats.

I'm also finding a lot un-wiped of front seat and dashboard areas full of sticky substances. The cars are never fully clean as someone who rents from them weekly.

This location does a shitty job of making cars ready for travel. As someone who has access to the execute cars due to the amount of travel I do. They fail to meet some simple travel requirements you expect when you rent. 

Next time you rent look underneath the seats in the passenger areas and you may find plastic bottle under them.

I would love for them to review the cameras and see who cleaned the car so they can fire them on the day I returned the rental! I brought them thousand of dollars and I do expect a refund for the stolen item.",2018-01-10 03:12:43

If someone were to visit me in St Louis, and ask for me to take them to a place that best captures the essence of St Louis; this place would be it. Located in the heart of South City on Morganford, The Haven is all you can imagine in your quintessential neighborhood bar.  The inside is like a shrine to St Louis traditions. Walls glittered with plaques of the arch and Cardinals greats. Neon beer signs illuminate the hard wood walls; and make you feel like you're at your uncle's basement all over again. Here is a place to get to know the real locals, the real St Louisians who have lived here their whole lives. As I sat here, I observed how everyone knew each other, chiming in here and there about how so and so's daughter is doing, and etc, etc. The wait staff was warm and welcoming, and the bar is a place where you can sit back and be yourself.

Its uniqueness makes it a perfect place to impress someone. As a more recent addition to the Bailey's group of restaurants, L'Acadiane is on par with the quality they are well known for.

If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general, you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon. 

Randall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp, but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations.

My first visit here was love at first sight.  Before I took a bite of pizza or a sip of the finest brew served there, I was hooked.  Pinball machines.  Ms Pac Man.  You had me at hello.  And an amazing juke box to go along with it all.

So the pizza.  Folks, do not eat all day and I bet you cannot eat more than two pieces.  The any and all chicago deep dish has literally everything but the kitchen sink on it.  Beware if you do not like jalepeno peppers because they are loaded up on there.  You can create your own from an array of toppings or sometimes, I just like the cheese pizza.  Folks, I swear the cheese pizza alone must weight ten pounds.  

Excellent ambiance.  Not a place to go if you are in a hurry as you will wait at least one hour on a Chicago style pizza.  Great place to go on a Friday night.  Get caught up with friends and just sit around shooting the shit.  Excellent beer selection especially on tap.

First Southern and now Grace Meat + Three. By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!

I met my brother here for a ""cheat day"" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.

In order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.

Review:
Hot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  

BBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.

Fried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.

Mac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.

Cornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.

Greens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.

Conclusion paragraph:
I had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott. However, I was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food!",2017-10-02 13:48:36

It's been about a month so I may be forgetting some details but what is clear in my memory is not to return. The lobby was updated and seemed nice and the room itself had a basic update. However, the toilet was set at an awkward angle and the bathroom ceiling sprinkler and fixtures were rusting.

Pros:
1) lots of seating and spacious - you're never scrunched up against other people
2) outdoor seating
3) food is FABULOUS
4) TONS of variety of food and drinks (e.g., more than 15 varieties of hot tea, four varieties of iced tea)
5) discounts if you bring in your own cup as well as a punch card to earn free stuff
6) free wifi
7) seasonal foods as well - including a great blueberry season (O.M.G.!!)
8) clean and well stocked
9) lots of parking - always able to find a spot (and right next to a FedEx)
10) locally/family owned - gotta love and support that

Cons:
1) with so much seating they need to invest in some sound dampening materials.  It is SO LOUD when there are many people there.  And when there aren't - you feel like other people can hear you.  I never feel like that at Bread Co. - busy or not.
2) the prices are a little high.  Not a lot.  Just a little too high.

Tried the classic breakfast, a nest egg and a hand squeezed OJ.  Firstly - super excited about housemade biscuits.  Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for ""normal"" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart. 

My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that. 

I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.  I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!",2016-09-18 21:22:18

We passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone's food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table, they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible, burnt, greasy, and very ""off"" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites, they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.

Our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery, and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally, I had NONE in my dish. It was absent, and sorely needed.

He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.  

I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru.

Seriously folks, don't be like the people I saw here and order a Chardonnay with your dinner...because it'll come from a mini bottle on a never dusted shelf of their never touched drink area. It's like the stuff you might get on an airplane. However, who in their right mind comes to black thorn for Chardonnay anyway??? It's all about the beer here.

I know this place seems sketch...they do not even have a menu online. Oh noes, what will I do? Well if you have a hankering for Chicago style deep  dish pizza and you want to know what they offer you seriously need to call them or look at the yelp pics of the menu. If they give you sas, well I'd say that's expected of a grungy place, but that's not necessarily true. I really didn't get a good feel for their attitude here. 

When I was there it took forever to get a drink because of how ""busy"" it was, but like I said it was mostly expected. It's tiny and a bit rundown feeling like a dive bar. Not my favorite feeling but that's part of why they don't get 5 stars from me.

If it's busy you probably won't find seating immediately. The best solution is to scope things out and play some arcade games until something opens up! 

The pizza here is seriously an awesome combo while you are drinking. I love deep dish, and while black thorn isn't my all time favorite, it's pretty good for st Louis.

I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. 

Our Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. 

We went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. 
It's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits. These were some of the best I have had. 

The DP went with the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp were the same as the Blackened Shrimp we enjoyed as an appetizer. She liked them. They were hard to photograph in a dimly light bar, so trust us when we say they tasted better then they photographed. 

Being a bar diner, I was highly impressed with the comfort and style of the barstools. The back was low, giving good back support and they had armrest for extra comfort. Only thing lacking at the bar was hooks underneath for ladies to secure their purses and outlets to allow social media junkies to keep charged up. 

Nathan was a great bar host and mixologist. He's a transplant from Tulsa and is adjusting to new city very well. Stop by and welcome him to STL. 

Will I return? - I hang out in Lafayette Square - so, YES!

Drive-thru had about 10 cars in line, so I decided to go inside. A continuous line of 6 to 10 people were waiting to place their orders the whole time I was there. I got the big box, 3 chicken strips, biscuit rice and beans and Cajun fries. Chose the BBQ sauce for dipping. The only thing I would say was a bit overdone, was the breading on the chicken. A bit too much. The sauce was excellent. Tangy and spicy. It was very good. The place was clean and the crew was working like a well oiled machine. Very smooth. The wait was not too long. Finally, my wait is over, as I was hoping for a Popeyes in south county for over 25 years. :)",2015-09-09 22:25:22

The menu is strictly dumplings and we went with the crab and pork mixture; 8 dumplings for $12. Note to everyone,  cash only for orders under $25. Thankfully we came prepared. First came out a bowl of chicken broth for each of us. I tasted it and it made me worry for the dumplings. The broth was quite similar to water with very little seasoning and not the greatest flavor. But then the little bundles of joy came out, pretty quickly I might add. The lady behind the counter was extremely sweet and asked if this was our first time as we were googling the art of dumpling eating. She explained the best way to go about it and said many people mix and match each dumpling with the provided soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili sauce. The broth within the dumpling was seasoned to perfection and our only complaint was that there wasn't more in each little dumpling pocket. The dumplings themselves were divine as well, packed with meat and flavor. The 4 stars comes from the rather steep price for the amount of tiny sized dumplings you get. We were satisfied after 1 order but definitely would have needed at least 1 more to be full.",2018-06-09 13:52:19

The menu offers so many different options ranging from catfish to prime rib all featuring a unique style of southern comfort soul taste to them all. 

I ordered the fried chicken normal style (I don't do heat but the spicy was recommended) IT WAS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN IVE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN. It fell right off the bone! I got the grilled broccoli which was amazing and the Mac and cheese which was also amazing. 

Our friends ordered the ribs, catfish (which was fantastic as well!) and prime rib. All tasting so very delicious. The craft beer adds a different take to the style as well, all complimenting the food.

Or, you have a craving for cheese fries or shakes. 

We got 4 meals between the 3 of us since it was their first time. I've been to Steak 'n Shake numerous times over my 30+ years in stl and I've never gotten the chili mac/5 way. I'm glad I finally got it. It was the best part of our meal. Note, we did need to order an extra cup of chili because there just wasn't enough sauce on it. 

The Chicago dog wasn't for me but honestly I barely like hot dogs and usually only eat them off the BBQ grill when they're close to burnt. The bright green relish threw me off for sure. But my friend seemed to like it/ate it all. 

The kids sliders weren't a hit. The 8 year old we were with was not a fan. They were pretty skimpy, but also the whole meal was only like $2.75 so I guess it makes sense. We ordered a single steak burger with bacon as well and it was standard/as expected. It was good enough that we ordered a second one for the 8 year old after the kids meal didn't go over well.

Because there was poop in the toilet and dried, crusted pee on the seat.  Let me say that again, juuuuust in case you missed it.  FECES IN THE TOILET AND DRIED, CRUSTED URINE ON THE TOILET SEAT.  I called the front desk on our way to dinner so the situation could be corrected.  The front dest assured us that the room would be clean before we got back.  Upon returning to the room, the toilet was still disgusting, though we could tell that someone had half-a**ed cleaning some of it.  I called again and was told that housekeeping had cleaned it (the aforementioned pee and poo told me otherwise) but they would send some one again.  Eventually someone did come and clean it.  

I'm sorry, at the absolute very least, a hotel room should have a clean bathroom.  This was beyond disgusting.  On top of all that, the hallways smelled like stale cigarettes and body odor.

Soup dumplings are rarely available in St. Louis anywhere and now I have a place to get these scrumptious dumplings that you bite into and the  soup comes bellowing out into your mouth. Amazing! The restaurant is casual and small.  Simple design with a counter and tables.  The owners are super nice.  It is located in a strip mall along with some of my other Chinese favorites.  These dumplings are very labor intensive and they just opened.  So, they sell out early everything takes time.  Don't go if you don't have a little time on your hands.

Instead of opting to go to a sit down place we decided to drive thru Steak n Shake. It had been forever since we had been to one so looking at the menu was something we had to do. I was hoping to get a chicken melt, but I didn't see that on the menu. Instead, they had a grilled chicken sandwich and that seemed to be the only chicken sandwich I saw, so I ordered it. My husband just wanted to order a burger with fries. There was a car in front of us so we didn't think much of it. We placed our order and were told to pull around to the window to pay. The car in front of us was still waiting so that's exactly what we did too. It took about 10 minutes for the car in front of us to get their meal and then we pulled up to pay. Once we paid we waited for about 6-7 minutes before our food was ready. I guess it's a good thing they cook our food to order, but that was a long time to wait IMO.

Update: I went inside this time where there were maybe 3 tables sat and 3 people waiting on orders at the counter.

Five minutes after I sat down one of the servers was greeting the table right  behind me just as they were sitting down. When she was finished I flagged her down and told her I'd been sitting here for five minutes and no one waited on me. She apologized and said it was Tom's section but that she'd take care of me. I ordered the penne Roma (no peas or mushrooms) and a water. Everything went just fine after that and the pasta was about the same as it would have been at any pasta house restaurant.

That issue seems to have been addressed (largely by myself), but since then I've had naked burgers, fries that looked like they were swept off the floor, undersized orders, and most recently, long delays while they leave my burger down near the grill where it can't be seen. One of the girls walking by loudly mocked me by saying ""Is this customer still waiting for his order??"" None of them ever touched it. It took me 17 minutes of standing there while others were served around me before I could get the attention of the manager, who got me my bag in 10 seconds.

I don't like needless conflict in my life. I don't want to be part of this war. I am at peace with different people. I would hire them without prejudice. I am always as polite as I can be there. I honestly am.

This place is consistently and deliberately hostile. Their service is pointedly antagonistic toward anyone they don't like the looks of, and they don't care how far they take it. In the two years I've been going there, the management has not been effective in controlling the issue.

The Haven is a perfect neighborhood bar by anyone's standards. It has a full menu including several nicer dinner specials. Lots of drink deals going on here, esp during sports games.

For those fanatics out there, there is a Golden Tee, sadly no Big Buck Hunter. And on an even better note, older people were hanging out and drinking here. One of my favorite things about places in the city is to go where my elders go. Those places are almost guaranteed to be friendly and legit.

I have to say the Pizza is well worth the wait.  Sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes, others 45, sometimes upwards of an hour but the pizza is always amazing.  

The bar area is great.  It kind of reminds me of the dives my grandfather would take me to so he could grab a beer really quick when he was out running errands for my grandmother.  Smokey, dimmely lit, but delightful and lots of character.  There's always music playing, the walls have all sorts of customer art and funny messages on them from the many visitors both in town and out of town.  I think I could spend hours just reading all of the messages in on the walls in the dining room and the bathroom.  Either way I doubt I'd stop laughing.   

Late night the place really comes alive. Each time I've been there after 9 I've always left with a great memory and a great story.  The bar always has cheap pitcher specials to take you into the night during those long shuffle board tournaments or Golden Tee rounds.

People think the wait is long because the pizza is so good.  That's not it at all.  Actually, the bar/restaurant has an operations problem.  The kicthen is inadequate to handle the type of pizza (thick crust) they serve.  So, you wait forever.  That's forgivable.  But what isnt?  The fact that the pizza is average at best, probably below average for deep dish.  Go to Chicago, or anywhere they have quality deep dish and you will find much, much better pizza.  In addition to all that, you basically have to serve yourself (i.e. go to the bar every time you need something).  On top of that, the place is a dump.  I'm not talking about a ""dive""...I'm talking about a ""dump"".  They do have games to play while you wait, so I guess that is good.  Anyway, don't believe the hype on this one.  Do it once to mark it off your list and move on. :)",2008-08-29 13:24:09

It was my nightmare to get out of the apartments. They don't consider sub lease, straight away tells that they have people waiting in line so wouldn't cater sub lease and if i am on notice and GOD forbid something goes wrong, i have to go out of the apartment anyway. What??? I have lived in several parts of the country and rented apartment but they are the worst ones to handle.

Again after 2.5 years living there, they are charging me for paint and marks inside which were of the chairs near to the walls and resurfacing of the laminated kitchen countertops. Igot the house professionally cleaning but cleaning services and still have to pay them 400-450 dollors for the non sense things. Only the legible item was bath tub for which they charge 150$ and everything else was just crap.

I checked with other and everyone asked me why i got it cleaned when they are anyway going to impose the fines. That was my bad because i don't have such thing seen in past. But that's how you learn..anyway.

Maintenance wise they are the laziest team i have seen. To respond to any issue, their SLA is 48 hours and they will come for once and will say that they need to check with supervisor and wouldn't return ever. Once you check with Leasing office, the ticket is resolved already.

Anyway Past it Past but somewhere we are responsible for them to behave in this manner. If i am not happy and want to leave, 10 others are standing in the queue to have it because of Indian community preferring these apartments because of the connectivity and low prices.

Now as some of the other reviewers have stated, this is a true dive bar, not the cutesy, intentional dive bar, but all out duct taped booths, graffiti covered bathroom, ""we ain't doing anything here unless the roof is collapsing"" dive bar - which I actually kind of like:)  I didn't have any interactions with the employees other than showing my ID to get in, but the husband never complained when he came back from ordering.  

They are definitely a no nonsense kinda place.  We were told, ""Menu's on the table, head up to the bar when you are ready to order.""  But luckily we were able to snag a booth right away and didn't have the stress of table stalking and waiting for someone to leave in order to sit down.  We waited about 45 minutes for our pizza, which was fine because it's what we expected going in, so we just chatted with our friends and enjoyed a pitcher of beer while we waited.  

We ended up sharing a medium (12-inch?) Chicago style with peps and mushrooms and I pretty much fell out of the booth when I saw the cheese oozing out - this was my kind of pizza!  Now if you are all about the sauce and toppings I would not recommend this because the bread and cheese are the obvious standouts.  I was a little worried that with all the cheese the crust would be soggy but it was awesomely crisp on the bottom and probably sturdy enough to pick up had I wanted to.  The sauce was deliciously spicy and we guessed might have had sun dried toms in it to give it the deeper hue?  After one slice I was full, after another half slice I was woozy, this pizza is no joke!  

So now I can finally say we have been to Black Thorn and I will happily return the next time a pizza craving or urge to eat a pound of cheese in one sitting strikes.  Thank you for the fun night out!",2012-03-03 23:40:45

And in the case of the Daily Bread, I wonder if that's an important distinction. Many of the reviews about the poor service and dirty tables seem to be from as far back as 2010. I just haven't found that they back up my experience there so far.

I generally go for lunch when it's the most busy. And despite that, the orders are taken fast, they've yet to be messed up and the food is prepared fairly quickly. They have a decently sized outdoor area, which is great -- because honestly I have never wanted to spend much time inside. I've found that it tends to be kind of cold in there and it's often packed to the gills and loud. But the outdoor area is quite nice.

That said, I've liked all of the food I've had. The buffalo chicken melt is OK, but I was really happy with the various vegetarian options and the smoked salmon sandwich. They have some great deli-style sandwiches too. There's just a lot of very different options here, the ingredients are fresh and things are just paired together well. They have a pretty nice soup combo too, which is barely more than the individual sandwiches.

A friend of mine had some of their frosted cookies too -- whoever is decorating them really knows what they're doing. I can't speak of the taste though, as I've not tried one.

However, the pizza is worth it. The Chicago style is enormous. I can't finish more than one slice. The sauce (according to a Vegan friend) is Vegan in nature.

I understand you want to know about...IS THE FOOD GOOD BRUH...is it worth my drive....and TRUST ME when I get to that....you'll gas up and get there.  

As I was saying....CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING.  I scheduled a business meeting there at lunch not having been to this establishment and many people I know hadn't been to this place to give a heads-up so allow me to tell you....THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NOTHING SHORT OF 5 STAR at LUNCH!   Both hosts were recent graduates of h.s., one on his way to SEMO.   They were well versed on the menu, the specials, the lay out, and you knew from the moment they opened their mouths to the moment you sat down after them having carried your tray, and retrieved your beverage of choice...THEY WERE HIRED TO SERVE YOU, and that they did with excellence and pride in what they did.   

I know....where is this place....and why haven't I heard about it.....well had it not been for my travel through the 170 corridor, and then catching a super late at night (early a.m.) advertisement I wouldn't have known about this SOUL FOOD GEM!  I know...there are a few spots that BOAST, but this isn't one that does, but once you GO, EAT, and ENJOY it will easily become your FAVORITE.   I didn't visit the restroom areas, but if it was anything like the front of house (clean as the dept of health....white glove military clean...) and the dining area.....I'd believe you if you said you could eat off the toilet seat it was that clean.  NOW ON TO THE FOOD:

The had some very tempting choices, and almost exhaustive (The WIDOWMAKER, SHRIMP PO'BOY and the TRIPLE  DECKER CLUB) were amongst the heavy hitters as far as sales go.   I personally wanted a good crispy tripe sandwich, but the manager (who hadn't tried it...) said I'd order from the table first if I were you.  Which was her way of encouraging me to order from the steam table that offered liver and onions, smother pork chops, fried chicken, smothered fried chicken, meatloaf as entrees, then followed by sides such as green beans, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, cabbage, black eyed peas, and few other mentionables.   The WAY BACK WEDNESDAY special was an entree with two sides and I cautiously proceeded ahead.   I had the meatloaf, cabbage, and mac n cheese there were accompanied by cornbread muffin. 

MEATLOAF was more than enough, and I'd guess it was 5-6oz of a thick slice wonderfully tasty monolithic masterpiece of juicy, well seasoned beef with some green peppers, onions throughout.  It has house made tasty gravy over it that didn't over-power it, but complimented it.  I actually and eventually ended up mixing it ( the meatloaf and gravy with my mac n cheese).  Now I must tell you this meat loaf didn't have the traditional layer of baked on ketchup or tomato paste to top it....and honestly it didn't need it at all.  

MAC N CHEESE - This is look a mix of grandmas home made mac n cheese that was made by CHESTER CHEETAH.  Let me explain:  most home made macs have that baked crust that sometimes...often times....has areas of burns that we just chalk it up to the mac game, and it's still edible.  Other times home made macs are so cheesy that they are soupy and you'd have to bake them in a crematory before you get a crust.  This mac n cheese was a mix of golden yellow and orange deliciousness.  I'd err on the side of caution of one of the BEST if not THE BEST SOUL FOOD MACS in our area  ( I do have a favorite MAC...and it's from of all places a BBQ joint in the loop....UNTOUCHABLE) ...it paired well with my meatloaf and gravy for sure. 

FRIED CABBAGE:  Just like my grandmama or my momma, or I make....straight from the south.   It wasn't terribly overcooked but tender and flavorful.   A hint of salt, pepper, garlic...( I believe it even had some cayenne pepper flakes that gave it a nice kick) and possible in a light chicken stock broth.  Had I not been on this diet I would've had to take the corn bread (sweet I might add) and mix it up in my cabbage,unbuckle my belt, kick off my shoes....and call it a done deal!  

 My only negatives are be cognizant of your clientele with music volume.....you may want to turn it down 1-2 notches so they can enjoy your food, the establishment, and one another without having to talk over or louder than the background music, and  I wanted to speak to the owner (as well as my constituent did too) to simply behold the owner of this gem.  TRUST I WILL BE BACK, and will tell others of the wonderful experience we had.  We don't have a place like this in St. Charles County and if you're looking for, or considering a second location...I'd highly encourage you to head WEST ON 70, so we can bless you!

We had a ""supreme"", pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onion and green pepper. Chicago style. 

I don't know what kind of magic they do to this pizza in the 50-60 minutes it takes to prep and cook, but it is absolutely worth it. 

There are some complaints about how long the pizzas take.  Before you shoot your f*cking mouth off, go watch what they're doing... They're pulling dough, rolling it, tossing it, prepping it in the pan, loading it with all the delicious stuff you asked for and baking it. And I think they broil the top quickly at the end to give it a nice crisp top, and a great flavor.  Sit down, relax, have a beer and wait. It was worth it. 

The bar looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s, which is awesome. I think if I had to gripe, I'd ask that they add a few seats... They seem sparse.

The bartender was so super friendly and approachable. When we were unsure about what beers to order, he offer to let us sample. Barkeep was an A+ man, but it was self serve; so overall, service was a B.

We ordered a pitcher of ESB Schlafly, small garlic bread, and a ten inch, two topping Chicago deep dish pizza with sausage and mushroom. The garlic bread was underwhelming. It hadn't been baked enough so the cheese on top of the garlic bread was lukewarm and not stretchy. You also couldn't taste the garlic and it was quite salty. I liked the crunchy bits on the edges, but there wasn't that much. It was reminiscent of the cheese bread from Papa John's. Also, it was 10 inches, aka huge.

The pizza. (Disclaimer we were quite full on beer and bread when we starting eating the pizza.) The crust was drier and flaky and quite thick. When the pizza first came out, the bottom crust was nice and crusty. However, the longer the pizza sat, more and more oil seeped through the crust, leaving it quite dense. The sauce was good and balanced. The sausages were really large and very spiced, which made it the prima dona of the pizza. The mushrooms were nice. Overall, we were disappointed about the deep dish that we heard so much about.

Atmosphere wise: it was chill. It is a great place for a group of friends to go out and unwind together. It was relatively quiet (it was a Thursday night though), so it makes for a chill night out.",2015-04-17 02:36:26

Firstly, the cookies are the best sugar cookies in town - cakey, not too sweet, and real-tasting. As a bonus, they are also gorgeous to look at - the details the bakers pay attention to are unreal. As you can see in my photo, they drew little flowers on the tea hat, using metallic icing to accent, and finished them with the birthday girl's name! They will box them, or even individually wrap them in cello bags with a nice raffia ribbon (if you are planning to use them for place cards or favors).

This place is amazing. Everyone is extremely friendly and the fish is super fresh for the Midwest. Make sure you keep your expectations in check though, we are landlocked by quite a distance.

You also get unlimited toppings with avacado and Kim chi being extra. I've had poke quite a bit on the coasts and have found that the best combinations tend to have a mix of something crunchy (chips or fried onion), something savory (spicy poke sauce, Kim chi), and something sweet (Thai sweet chili sauce, mango, or pineapple). My go to combo is white rice w/chips, ahi tuna, crab salad, seaweed salad, mango, green onion, fried onion, sweet Thai chili sauce, spicy mayo, sesame seeds, and togorashi seasoning.

If you can, I've found sharing a large bowl between two ppl is plenty of food, as long as you both can agree on toppings this is def the way to go and much cheaper than getting two bowls.

Seating in the resteraunt is ample and it's always very clean and well lit. It's hard to beat a healthy, fresh, and quick resteraunt in cwe. People will naturally compare to.blk mrkt eats, both are delicious, but pokedoke bowls are def better than blk mrkt bowls. But there sushi-rittos are different and delicious as well.

The chicken breast was cooked perfectly and complimented it so well. Everything was fresh. Seriously. Everything. The chicken and noodles had just been made and the vegetables, mint AND cilantro (thanks Mia) looked like they had just been picked. One of my friends had shrimp teriyaki and the shrimp were large. MK came out and introduced himself and told us that there was no rush for us to leave. Which was very kind.

I'm pushing 7 months pregnant, as of the time I write this, and I am going back for those pancakes- big dippers. You sometimes go out and get pancakes and they are kind of flat and rubbery... Almost as if they have been pre made and heated up, or microwaved. And, thus, remind me to only eat pancakes that we make at home. I was craving pancakes so I ordered the big dippers. I was initially skeptical about the concept that you get 6 pancakes that you tear up and dip in syrup. But, now that's the only way I want to eat pancakes- these stay fluffy and delicious and only need a tiny bit of syrup dipped on the edge. These are NOT those gross French toast sticks you get at the grocery store freezer aisle; they make it all right in front of you. 

They even have a drive through!!! Also, a created problem for me now, 

Husband got slinger on a sandwich and said it was delicious! 

But, seriously, there was a four year old sitting a few seats away from me (it's a big shared long table in the middle of the room) who got the kid's version of what I got (the Little Dippers) and proudly exclaimed, ""These pancakes are really good!!!"". Aren't four year olds the experts on pancakes? 

Also, I was fascinated by the idea that they have an old-school coffee ""club"" where you rent a mug on the wall with your name on it and come in and get coffee in your very own reserved mug.

Also, also, this joint makes custom cakes- gooey butter cake, cheesecake, cookie cakes, and.....wedding cakes!? (Yes, wedding cakes.) 

Go have breakfast here. Get pancakes. You need pancakes. Who doesn't need pancakes? Ok, maybe people who have issues with gluten, but everyone else.",2016-12-04 03:37:14

When we arrived, the server took our order, but did not write anything down (this will come back later), and brought out our drinks.  The appetizer was correct, and was delicious; we asked for some water. Then the table next to us received their entrees, and we were told ours would be next... The table next to us finished their entire meal before we had a server come to us to let us know our order was coming.  Still no water, so we asked again.  
Eventually, the main course comes, and mine is not correct.  I had ordered the BBQ Beck Burger with onions and french fries.  I received a Beck Burger (no BBQ sauce), a pickle (no onions) and chips (no fries).  The server plopped down our food and left without saying a word.  I was hungry so started eating my burger.  The server comes back about 5 minutes later, and asked if I was supposed to have sauerkraut.  I said no, but it was supposed to have BBQ sauce, I should have had fries, and we were still waiting on water.  We received a look from the server that we were being jerks, and she said, ""well, that's basically the same (referencing the chips), but I'll get you some fries"".  She brings some BBQ sauce, fries, and water (finally!).
The burger was even better with the sauce.  The fries were dry and stale.
After we had finished our meal, the server came back and asked if I was finished, I said yes, and asked for the check.  The plates were removed, and the server left.  10 minutes later, the server returns, and asks if we would like anything else.  I again ask for the check.  Another while later, and the check finally arrives.
If it hadn't been for the horrible service, I would have given this place 5 stars.  But on that same note, if the food hadn't been so good, it would have only gotten 1 star.
So, if you don't mind waiting forever for food, it's really good.  Just be warned, the servers aren't too friendly.  It will be a long while before I will go again.",2012-04-30 20:33:27

After living in the Tower Grove area for nearly 2 years, I finally decided to give Black Thorn a shot. All I've heard were good things minus the long wait people usually endure when coming here.

Jason and I got here around 7:30. To our surprise there was not a line nor was it insanely busy like we had anticipated. Another thing we had not anticipated was the set up of the place.

You have to place your order at the bar, get your own drinks from the bar, and pay all before you receive your pizza if you aren't going to keep an open tab. It basically has the same concept as a Bread Co. or Qdoba. Once you order, they'll bring you your pizza out.

We ordered a 12 inch Chicago style sausage and pepperoni pizza and a bowl of caesar salad to hold us over until the pizza came out. Little did we know that we were going to wait 30 minutes to receive the salad, then an additional 30 minutes after that for our pizza. As mentioned before, it was not busy. It had a few patrons, but not enough to cause the wait like we had to.

8:30pm. Pizza is out. We're ready and holy hot damn, am I excited! The pizza lived up to the hype I had hoped for. The time spent waiting was well worth every bite I ate. I think the only downside is the wait time. I don't know how long it takes to cook the pizzas. I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?

As far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, ""when we get to it."" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!

Anyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn. The rustic looking 1980s dive bar setting who outlived its hay day truly adds character to this place. It has darts, hurling, and a juke box. You can't go wrong, especially in this hipster neighborhood.

Come check it out and you'll see what I mean.",2012-01-05 05:25:02

Although they still have some kinks to work out with meal timing, the service overall was fantastic.

The decor is absolutely beautiful. It felt warm and inviting but also very modern and fun. We started our meal with the crab cake and the corn dogs. I was a bit surprised to see a crab cake appetizer with only one crab cake. I think it would have been better to have two smaller crab cakes to make it easier to share (it is an appetizer). However, the flavor of it was very good. The corn dogs were also good, but the portion size felt very off to me. It was served with five corn dogs, but they were almost the size of my palm. This required us to use a knife to eat them, so then the breading was falling off, making it somewhat strange to eat. I would have liked to see this served differently. For our meals, we both ordered the jambalaya. I enjoyed the sausage and tiny shrimp in the dish and felt it added some much needed texture. I found myself seeking those bites out and stopping when they were gone. I was surprised at the dish it was served in. It essentially came out in a boat instead of a bowl, which I felt was an odd choice. Our server, while a nice person, was not very helpful in terms of recommending items on the menu. For a new restaurant, I wanted to hear the house recommendations or customer favorites so far. They also went missing for about thirty minutes after we were served our main dishes and we had to flag someone down to get our check.

I waited at one of the registers for about 5 minutes (way to long in my opinion) for someone to at least acknowledge that I was standing there and that they would be with me in a moment.  Didn't happen.  I finally leaned over to speak with several of the people working behind the registers (I could see) so I knew they also saw me.  I ask if I was in the right area to place an order.  The girl yelled over to two other ladies that were filling the drink machine and said......Hey, you have a customer here.  I apologized to the cashier once she was taking my order.  That I didn't mean to cause a problem just wasn't sure where to place my order since it was my first visit.  She said NOTHING!

I placed an order for the albacore tuna sandwich.  I saw on the menu board that it came with chips and fruit.  When they called my number I was given a bag with only a sandwich.  I ask if  the chips and fruit came with my sandwich and the server that handed me the sandwich rolled his eyes and looked at the lady that had yelled for the cashiers.  She said, yeah you can help yourself to the chips and a banana or apple.  I know I would have walked out of there without the sides (if you will) if it would have been left up to the server.

I took the sandwich (sides) back to work.  I was very disappointed with the tuna.  Not much tuna, lettuce and tomato on a large bun . What seem to be a very strong garlic taste was evident and I was unable to finish the sandwich.  I offered the remaining half to a co-worker who didn't care for it either.

By far the worst company me & my wife have ever experienced in our entire lives. Our overall move experience was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. From start to finish our relocation was extremely poorly handled by United Van Lines. Being guaranteed during our quote that if we signed with United Van Lines they would have our belongings loaded and arrived at our new location by 8-1-17. After numerous interactions with the moving coordinator and being lied to about the status of our property, our belongings weren't delivered until 8-11-17 and 8-14-17 due to additional loads being added and our stuff being split into two separate trucks without our approval. I drove from MN to AZ and incurred multiple moving expenses due to the lies about when the truck was leaving MN with our property. Given these multiple delays we notified United Van Lines we would not be at our new house to receive the first truck due to a family wedding we were in. United Van Lines then wanted us to pay additional money to have it stored overnight for all of their mistakes & incompetence. In a new city where we know nobody we made arrangements to fly someone down to AZ to be present while the first truck was unloaded while we flew back to MN. Obviously even more unnecessary costs incurred because of United Van Lines . United Van Lines is responsible for numerous damaged items as well as 9 lost boxes that are irreplaceable. This kind of service is absolutely ridiculous especially coming from the largest moving company in the entire country. To add the cherry on top our claims process has been equally miserable as the move itself. We submitted our claim on 9-26-17 and did not receive the claim check until 2-17-18 to replace all of the property that was damaged & lost by United Van Lines. The claims coordinator for United Van Lines never kept us in the loop as to our claims status, we always had to initiate the conversation and even then were lied to about its status as they continually told us a new date to expect reimbursement. United Van Lines should be embarrassed with their customer service during our move as this process is inexcusable and no doubt the worst service we've ever experienced. I will NEVER recommend this company to anyone looking for a successful & easy move. Rest assured my letter to the Betterbusinessbureau will say this exact same thing about United Van Lines.

Their fries aren't bad, though I've learned to order them well done, as sometimes they can be a bit on the rawer side for my liking. The wings are good too. My boyfriend likes the BBQ, I like the hot. They're crispy, either way, which is great, and the BBQ type are loaded with sauce. If you aren't a super saucy fan, do like I do, and ask for it on the lighter side. 

Ranch dressing is good as well. Seems homemade, and isn't super thick and filling like some I've had. It's great on one of their salads, which I've had good experiences with. Onion petals are good, albeit filling and a bit greasy, although I think that's the point of onion petals, is it not? Burgers are excellent, and huge, and taste homemade. I get mine with provel and bacon, and I'm in food heaven.

The television situation there is always a bit of a challenge for me. I don't care for football whatsoever (I'm a total baseball girl, who bleeds red), but football seems to be the sports programming of choice at The Haven. I don't understand that, because it's usually not Rams games, but teams of other states that they have on the televisions there, even when the Cardinals are playing a game that day, at the same time, but ... whatever. To be fair, whenever I've asked the waitresses at The Haven to turn at least one television to the baseball game, the waitresses have done so without hesitation, so I can't complain much, but it would be nice to have the Cards game on all of the time, whenever one is playing, without having to ask.

The waitresses are all nice, and they get to know regulars like me pretty quickly (I live up the street, so I stop by quite often). Arrici (excuse my spelling if I am spelling it wrong) is my fav waitress at The Haven, and is always super helpful, and a real gem. The Haven is lucky to have her. She always takes good care of me whenever I visit. 

Drink prices are on the cheap side, which is nice, and they aren't stingy with the amount they give in regard to food or liquor. I'd like to see more choices offered on draft, such as Bud Select instead of the darker Schlafly Ale they offer on tap, but maybe this will happen in time.

(my husband was in the military)  United can't be bothered to give us a quote because they want to look at everything.

We like the modern rustic decor (similar to the Fixer Upper home renovation TV show, Joanna Gaines' style) with wood floors, pastel colors and open space. We're always received with a warm and hearty welcome and an introduction to the menu and daily specials when we arrive. After making our order at the counter we're free to sit anywhere in the large open room. 

My favorite item here is the fried chicken. We've only had the non-spicy option but not the spicy. Always crunchy and well seasoned, I like that its moist without being oily, even the white meat is tender. In my opinion, the seasoning on the chicken skin plays a key role in my decision of whether I like it. Every bite of Rick's Famous Fried Chicken is crispy and bursting with soulful flavor. 

We've also had the cornmeal fried catfish. Crisp crust on the outside yet flaky, soft and mild flavored on the inside. Served in several smaller 1-2 bite-sized pieces with a dipping sauce. Great entree, second only to the fried chicken or if you'd like a lighter offering. 

We've had a variety of the sides. The are a few staples and some others that rotate. I always like the honey sweet, and savory cornbread. We've liked the mashed sweet potatoes, sweet and savory, and always topped with a little nutty crunch for a  contrast in texture. The Mac and cheese is also a reliable side, creamy and delicious.

Pros: 
-Reasonable price 
-lots of topping choices, incl seaweed salad which is usually extra $$
-fish tastes a lot fresher than all other raw fish I've had at sushi places in STL 
-super friendly staff, people approached my table twice to ask how I liked things, and cleared my tray for me. 

Cons:
-reeeeally small poke portions. Scooper was the size of a tablespoon and my server underfilled it on 2/4 of my scoops. For a large you are paying $12 for about 3 oz of fish, if that. 
-No soy sauce or sriracha, a staple at every other poke place I've ever been to. 
-they only have forks, no chopsticks?!? I guess that one is petty, but... it's like having only forks at a sushi place...

You know when you go shopping with a friend, and they try on an ill-fitting/ugly shirt, and they think it's OMGSOCUTE, and you just don't have the heart to tell them that it's just not working for them? You just want to shake them and tell them they could do SO much better, but instead you smile and tell them that they look GREAT?

Actually, I'm not that friend at all (I'm brutally honest; don't ask for my opinion unless you REALLY want it), but for the sake of this review, let's pretend that I am. 

The Island Frozen Yogurt is the equivalent of that ugly shirt that your friend is in LOVE with.

And honey, I'll let you in on a little secret: you could do SO much better. 

Don't get me wrong, The Island is cute. It's an adorable tropical-themed froyo shop in the heart of Soulard, and if you want to stay in the city, it's one of your only options. 

Let me take a moment to NOT be a food snob and say that The Island isn't THAT awful. They have a pretty decent variety of flavors (even though vanilla was one of the only ones I could choke down, and YES, I sampled every flavor...#fatty). The service was fantastic (the guy working the day I visited? I want to squeeze him into my pocket and take him home with me). And the price was reasonable. 

But back to the froyo itself. It had a weird consistency. Almost icy. It's such a far cry from the sweet, rich, velvety, DELICIOUS froyo that Yogurtland (or Red Mango, or Orange Leaf) serves. Remember the self-serve vanilla frozen yogurt that you gobbled down at Old Country Buffet as a kid (just me? Ooookay)? Or the frozen yogurt at Sweet Tomatoes? The frozen yogurt at The Island is like that. And hey, if you're into that, do yo thang. I won't hate. You go, Glen Coco! 

But...can I tell you something? You know, just between me and you? Promise you won't get mad? Okay.

That shirt? Looks like shit on you.",2012-05-02 17:25:08

I understand my situation was complicated, but I was doing everything that I could to be accomodating...why do you think the appropriate response is snapping at me?

I ended up saying that I would talk at a later date, and decided not to use the company. I called back later asking if they would please remove my contact information as I would not be using them.

The Pros:
Spacious rooms and comfortable beds.
Wonderful staff - They were efficient and kind with every request. They threw in one of their conference rooms with our deal and it became our production office. 
Location - Not far from downtown and in a quiet area.

Cons:
Air conditioning unit was so so. It either worked and was loud or did not work and we roasted.
The layout is kind of cumbersome. It is a long walk from the entrance to the main elevators. 
The decor is straight out of the 70's and sometimes the hotel has a musty smell.

Overall, it was a comfortable place to rest my tired bones for a week. The staff is really the main selling point. Because I travel for work,  I find myself really relying on hotel staff much more then I do when I'm traveling for leisure.",2015-05-30 20:20:11

First of all, my eyes were dilated without warning or being told of the side effects which included me not being able to see or drive for the rest of the day. If you had other plans, forget about it don't even count on your vision to help you pick out a fresh pair of specks. 
The eye glasses are extremely over priced- go ahead and add another one to two hundred  bucks to a pair of glasses compared to other places. Oh, they had a promotion going on which was 60% off a pair of frames, but if you had a vision plan, then you can only use one or the other which doesn't save you much. Also, part of the vision exam is extra, but you aren't told about it until after that service. Now, I have had a lifetime of eye care, but my total never came close to 500. This time, my total was over 800 and thankfully with my insurance I had to pay only 204 but still, holy cow! Where do they come up with these extra charges since the frames I bought were less than what my insurance plan was willing to pay. So basically the 800 was my check up and lenses.

- This place is super dive-y, but that adds an odd sense of legitimacy to the pizza even before tasting it. The atmosphere makes you feel like you've found a hidden gem.
- There are like 2-3 people that work there at any given time, so I imagine if you're trying to order a pizza in their busy time, it would be a nightmare if you were really hungry at the time of ordering. (*** I recommend ordering ahead, before you're starving, and picking it up!!! ***)

- When I went to pick up my pizza, I could see evidence of home-made crust (i.e. some sort of mixing contraption and a lot of flour!). This is a win for SURE.

- As another reviewer (Courtney J.) astutely wrote, ""[their] Chicago style stuffed crust pizza is more of an homage to Chicago style deep dish than a textbook replica."" I couldn't agree more, and I couldn't have said it better myself. The pizza is kind of like an Italian-flavored quesadilla with raised edges, melty cheese, tomato sauce, and extra toppings on covering it. 

- Note: the deep dish pizza does not re-heat very well. Even using the best stovetop method (if you don't know about stovetop reheating of pizza, you're missing out, go check it out on youtube immediately!), you'll never achieve the same level of meltiness as when the pizza was first made.",2015-04-18 13:52:38

Bad idea! First, I ordered online, thinking that I was ordering from the store right up the street (Pine St). There is no estimated delivery time annotated so i just thought that it was because the sandwich would arrive so fast. At the end of the order, i see that the sandwich is coming from the Laclede store which is about 2 miles away and thought it was still cool. 15 minutes later, i called the store to confirm my order since i didn't receive an email. The person on the phone told me the driver left with my sand which 20 minutes ago, i knew this was a lie because i had only ordered the sandwich about 15 minutes ago.

Boxes completely ripped open or shredded down the side. A large tear in our leather couch, and a forged slip that claims it was already there. And a dresser that is so broken they had to leave it shrink wrapped for fear it would collapse.

What's worse is that they were beyond rude. Every time I noticed something broken, they immediately said ""Not our fault. Came out of the warehouse like that."" One, what warehouse? It should have stayed on the truck! Two, act like an adult and take responsibility. 

Even after all that, I tipped them, because while I thought they showed little respect or care, I know they did some heavy lifting. They did not say thank you or seem appreciative in any way.

We had just 20 minutes during our layover at STL, and we asked her which items on the menu would be served the quickest.  She said that the spaghetti and pasta options would be ready in 12 minutes (what an exact quote).  During the wait she brought us iced water in to-go cups so that we would be ready to run to our boarding gate as soon as our meal was ready.  Rather than simply calling our names back to the counter, she actually brought the food (complete with extra utensils and paper napkins) out to the waiting area.

-Charged $200 to box my tv into it's original packing, and then when the sub-contractors that packed my house came, they made us crate the tv.  
-Household items were 2 days late on delivery, after we made a special trip to our new state to meet the truck.  Were told that we would be compensated $200 each day they were late (we weren't).
-The subcontractors delivering the household items stacked as many boxes as possible in the garage, rather than in the house locations indicated on the boxes, since the garage was easier to get to.
-Many broken, scratched, and MISSING items.  In one example we received half of the contents of one dresser drawer, but not the others.  Still waiting for the claim to be reviewed on the household items.
-They moved 2 cars as part of the move.  They had the cars for a month.  Delayed delivery twice, no showed once, and eventually delivered the cars.  Both cars are antiques, and were covered in black, greasy handprints.  As a result of being inside a carrier at high temps the older of the cars sustained significant damage.

She would not accept it because it was a debit/credit card. I explained that I had pre- paid for the rental and she said, ""Oh well, they (Priceline) know our rules.""  I told her I would check with Priceline because I had driven 1/2 hour to get there and paid for the car in advance.

This place has been on my radar even before it opened, thank you social media. My spouse and I checked out PokeDoke for dinner one night. Parking was pretty difficult to find, but it's to be expected as this restaurant is located in CWE.

I was having trouble figuring out which of the three sizes to choose. Small, regular, or large. I decided to go with the small which came with two scoops of protein. I had two scoops of the salmon with a base of white rice. I went with the medium poke sauce, but I think I'm going to go with the spicy next time. Toppings: mango, seaweed salad, masago, green onion, friend onion, and wasabi, all topped with a drizzle of wasabi mayo.

I'm not sure I can say it's the best poke I've ever had in my life, but it sure was tasty. The salmon was pretty good, I liked the poke sauce that was used. The toppings went really well with the meat and the rice. I really just see poke as a deconstructed sushi roll, which I already love. I was really surprised as to how full I was at the end of the meal. Though I chose the smallest size, I was pretty stuffed. If I had chosen the regular size, I would've been very uncomfortable.

I've been to Black Thorn Pub several times and I can honestly say that their pizza is the best deep-dish/Chicago style pizza in St. Louis.  While I am fan of pizzas with all sorts of toppings, the essence of simplicity is not overlooked at Black Thorn Pub.  You're not going to get a deep-dish white pizza with buffalo mozzarella, basil, grilled chicken, spinach, toasted pine nuts, olive oil, and a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar at Black Thorn Pub (okay...umm, actually that sounds pretty good!).  You'll get the pizza with toppings we all grew up with - sausage, mushroom, pepperoni, onions, green peppers - you know, the stuff we used to eat when went to birthday parties when we were kids!...the stuff that makes an all-around good pizza.  Frankly, anyone can take toppings, slap'em on a crust, add sauce, and call it pizza.  Black Thorn Pub achieves a harmonious balance with good toppings (albeit, simple toppings), good sauce (nice an'zesty, with a little tart to it), great mozzarella, and good crust.  That balance makes for a fantastic pizza.  

Like most growing boys, I could probably put down most of a medium pizza from the Hut, Dom's, or the Caesar.  This is highly unlikely at Black Thorn Pub - I mean, next to near impossible.  Two slices of their goodness is all I need to send me into a food coma.  After a particularly intense workout last night (the shirt-soaking kind), we thought it best to relax and unwind with pizza from Black Thorn Pub.  I mean, is there a better way?  We ordered a pie with sausage, mushrooms, and garlic, and it was awesome.  This was the second time we ordered that combination and we loved it.  In fact, I've got a leftover slice for lunch today!

I think we can all agree that Black Thorn Pub - at least the ""Pub"" aspect of it - either borders on, or just is, a dive.  But don't be distracted by that.  It's got a great neighborhood feel to it.  It is literally the ""bar on the corner"" that you could meet a friend for a beer, bring the team back after a gratuitous win, or take that special someone out for a great dining experience.  I've done all three, and have had a great time each time.  I would hope that Christine F. would go back there and give Black Thorn Pub a second chance despite her first experience (see, below).  I do agree, no one deserves to be treated that way, but we're not perfect, right?  I've worked in restaurants and bars, too, and no matter what, the customer's concern is what is most important.  Dude should not have treated her that way, let alone talked to her like that - that's clearly bullshit treatment.  But give the guy a second chance, hell...give Black Thorn Pub a second chance - if the shoe was on the other foot, I'm sure they'd want that second chance to impress her.

What have I concluded? Eat here when you are starving to death and it will taste 150 times better than if you were only hungry for a proper portion sized meal.

I ordered a pepperoni pizza 10 inch for take out last night. $13.50 isn't bad for the depth and size of the pizza. It may only contain 4 slices, but those 4 slices are comparable to a Domino's 8 slice pizza.

I ordered around 8:30pm and still had an hour wait even though when I went in they weren't that busy. Seems to be the case every time. Never slammed, but always the long wait. This is typical of Black Thorn I guess.

When we got home to eat our pizza, it seemed overly spicy with seasoning. Cheese seemed to be more on one side of the pizza than the other and not evenly distributed. After eating a single slice it just seemed to settle than digest in our systems. When Jason and I laid down in the bed we both agreed that we would never get that pizza again. Then the passing thought occurred, we still have to eat left overs.

Left overs were a lot better than the first initial piece we had. It tasted fresher. Does that seem weird? Probably. Still I think that was our final visit. It good pizza when you're starving, but I wouldn't advise going if you are only a little hungry.",2012-07-03 17:38:04

To be quite honest our experience at first was a bit jarring , but that's just because we'd never been to a breakfast/brunch place quite like it before. 

You order food from a counter and then try to find a place to sit. We're far from antisocial, but not big fans of community seating, so we jumped at the chance to sit at a dirty two top table as another couple was leaving. As we were taking our seats someone came right over wiped down the table for us (thank you!).

They were slammed so we were surprised to receive our food after waiting for what seemed like no more than 5 minutes. IT. WAS. INCREDIBLE. I had the Slinger Sandwich and my wife had the Mushroom Frittata. She described it as being ""the perfect blend between creamy and woodsy""... the only two words I can use to describe the slinger sandwich are ""More Please"".  Both meals came with a side of small potatoes. Not hash browns, not grits, whole potatoes. They too were nearly too good to be true.

2. This is a dive bar, so be ready for down to earth gritty.

It's a simple concept, basically fast casual for big breakfast entrees.  I wanted to try a bunch of stuff, so we ordered three entrees knowing some would be taken home.

My favorite was the Nest Egg.  It's a big ole crispy biscuit crust that has two sous vide eggs inside that mixed with the large bacon bits and cheddar for savory explosion.  Pickled red onion on top with preserved lemon bits gave a great contrast that rounded it out.  I'd say you have to try this.

The Mary B.E.A.R. was darn good too.  It's a sandwich made of a ciabatta bun, with brie, boiled egg, arugula, apple butter, and pickled red onion.  It had a light, but satisfying flavor, that left you fresh.

Pancake rollup was my least favorite.  It was an okay dish - 2 scrambled eggs, turkey chorizo, cheddar, pickled jalapeno, salsa all rolled up in a pancake (burrito style), with a lime cheese drizzle across it.  The lime cheese was a tart contrast to the rest of it, but too tart for me.  Turkey chorizo was decent, but could have had a stronger flavor.  The pancake also seemed to lake flavor.

They did let me try a few different options before settling on the raspberry beer at their suggestion. It was just okay. Nothing special but it was the best of the 3 that I tried so I landed on that.

When I first entered The Island, my eyes immediately went to the large dispenser containing clear refreshing liquid with thinly sliced cucumbers floating inside.  I jokingly asked, ""is that cucumber infused vodka?"".  The jovial cashier, gave a hearty laugh and informed me it was ""just water"". I have to admit I was disappointed, but once I sampled and filled my bowl with Froyo I was whisked away to a tropical ""island"". 

Those big chain Froyo shops have nothing on The Island, in fact The Island has them beat with flavor, toppings and customer service. I'm a purest,  I like my yogurt plain like my flavored vodka. I like to experience their true flavors to the fullest. 

My ""island"" experience included; Madagascar Vanilla, Root Beer Float and Cheesecake. The Root Beer Float was as if you truly were having one, except it was all yogurt and no soda. If you crumbled up some graham crackers with the cheesecake, you'd think you were eating the real thing. However, the Madagascar Vanilla was my favorite, it had true vanilla flavoring. Even as a child my favorite ice cream was vanilla, I guess old habits are hard to break.

First off, I do not understand why we're standing in line to order, and being served on institutional-style metal trays. It adds nothing to the charm of the place, and it is certainly not 'southern' in any sense. 
The food was uniformly mediocre. I had ribs, which were kind of dry and VERY salty, mashed potatoes, which were reminiscent of what they serve at KFC, summer squash with a sunflower seed pesto--the highlight of the meal--and cornbread. I am so tired of places serving cold, obviously hours-old cornbread. If Red Lobster can get fresh hot cheese biscuits on your plate every five or ten minutes, why can't other places serve hot fresh cornbread? It is really only good fresh and hot; it is nothing but a disappointment otherwise. 
Two of my friends had catfish, which looked pretty much like nuggets, served (for some reason) on a piece of cold white bread. My other friend had the special Korean ribs, which he shared out to the rest of us, apparently not that impressed with them. They all had greens, which they said were 'alright.' 
Fortunately, the place is not expensive, so we didn't waste a lot of money. But I absolutely fail to understand the hype surrounding this hugely mediocre eatery. Can't see myself going back.",2018-08-15 17:46:19

Dear Customer Care....
Here's a better idea since i will NEVER rent from Enterprise or National again (and I rent once a week as a Hertz Gold member)....
Since your Executives are in St. Louis (less than 10 miles away), try the experience yourself as a blind shopper. It is not my job to do your job for you. This way, you can ""enjoy this pleasant experience"" personally like the rest of us.

I will list positives and negatives about the staff/location/apartments in the bottom of the review.  My biggest gripe about the company is that if you do not sign a renewal contract (i was planning on moving but did not have a location when my contract was up) you pay an additional $200 dollars ON TOP OF MARKET PRICE FOR RENT.  This is not anywhere in the contract but is in the ""welcome booklet"" and gets glossed over in the paperwork section, so don't let them rush you through it.  It is not even initialed to indicate you have read it.  This could very well be legal but it is definitely shady.  However it is easy to get your security deposit back as long as you do what is indicated on the move out instructions.

Pros:
-rent is relatively cheap as long as you get some sort of deal for x amount of months
-Windows block lots of sound
-quiet area
-close to 270

Cons:
-depending on where you live in the complex there can be a lot of kids playing in the parking lot.  there is no apartment complex playground so you have to be vigilant not to squish one.
-buildings have lots of charm but the insides don't.  make sure you get a tour of the apartment you'd be renting. Not just the model
-If you need two things repaired don't bother submitting it on one repair request or two separate ones on the same day.  only one will get done.
-Not a very fun or lively area (hence its quiet, it is a double edged sword)",2016-07-18 00:02:47

The flavors here are changed up VERY consistently. I've been here several times now only to find new flavors each time. At least 50 different toppings are offered. Great hours (11am-11pm) and a perfect location.

The interior is neatly done in a cheesy type of manner that fits the ""Island"" theme of the place. Personally I wouldnt sit down and eat in here and I havent seen too many people doing so. Seems that most opt to eat outside (or take it home). 

Perfect spot to stop at if you are eating in the neighborhood and need your sweet tooth satisfied. Give it a try and it won't disappoint.

Favorite toppings offered:
Cheescake bits
Cookie dough bites
FRESHLY cut strawberries

Favorite Flavors:
Yellow Cake
Red Velvet Cake
Peanut Butter Blaster
Chocolate Milk-Shake",2012-06-04 21:23:25

My friend and I decided that the sides really appealed to us so we were going to order 3 sides and one sandwich to split. We had the catfish sandwich. It didn't have a catfish fillet but catfish strips so it wasn't the easiest to split butt that was on us.  (When we ordered the person taking our order said shed maker sure we had a separate plate to divide up our food.  Speaking of plates, they were trays... very cool.) The catfish was breaded in a nice cornmeal crust with a little kick. I don't remwmber there being any telish on it at all. We could've gotten it spicy but I'm a wuss. It was prefect.  Our sides were macaroni and cheese, mashed butternut squash... my fave, and roasted summer squash. We each had an adult beverage.  They were good but served in a jelly jar. I liked the presentation but for the price they were really small.  The 3 stars is because we talked more to the workers than to each other.  As soon as one left our table after asking how we were doing and if we wanted our player taken another stopped by.  I appreciate you checking on us but seriously the visits were non -stop. 
All this being said I'll be back... I have got to try the Fried Green Tomatoes, the Fried chicken,  the beets and the cornbread.
I'd also like to know what the meaning is behind their name.",2017-10-14 18:20:18

I've been wanting to try Black Thorn Pub for ages. AGES! And tonight, I finally was able to try it. 

I met a friend here around 7pm, and it was pretty empty. We grabbed some seats at the bar, and immediately ordered a 14"" Chicago deep dish with pepperoni and green peppers. We were both super hungry, and I heard that the pizza takes a while to cook here (and they only have one oven, apparently?), so we got right to business. 

After our order was placed, I was able to soak in the atmosphere a bit. Black Thorn is definitely a dirty dive, but I'm cool with that. There were a few pinball machines and such. Loud (and awesome!) music was being pumped over the loudspeakers. A couple of Muse songs were in the queue, which made me happy. 

I thought the service was fine. The girl working the bar was aloof, but nice. 

It took about 30 minutes for our pizza to come out, but it was DEFINITELY worth the wait. Piping hot and so so SO cheesy. Everything about this pizza was perfect. It was cooked perfectly. It had the perfect amount of toppings. The sauce was flipping FANTASTIC. The cheese was ooey gooey. And it was filling. 

And by filling, I mean that it took me 10 minutes to eat one slice, and even though I was ravenous at the beginning of the meal, one slice was all it took to bring me to a comfortable level of fullness. ONE SLICE. And friends, I am NOT one of those ""Oh, I just took a couple bites of salad and I'm full! Tee hee!"" types of girls. I can pack it in. And this totally filled me up. I'm going to stop now, because this is starting to sound dirty. 

Anyway, the pizza was fucking fantastic, and it's not a matter of IF I'll come back, it's WHEN.",2011-11-09 05:42:56

I've heard so much about this place since I moved to the city in February 2009.  We finally decided to go a few months ago to try their deep dish pizza.

We got there at 5:15pm on a Sunday evening, right after they opened at 5pm.  There were already a couple people in there.  It looked very old and a little dingy but Zack and I enjoy dive bars.  You could tell it was authentic.  If you're looking for a ""hip"" place to get pizza and don't mind spending more, go to Pi.

Everyone at Black Thorn orders from the bar.  When they call your name, you come up to get your pizza.  It took a little under an hour to get our Chicago Style deep dish pizza.  Since it was early on a Sunday, we didn't mind, but if you're really hungry and don't want to wait, this isn't the place to go.  However, the long wait sure builds up your appetite for the huge deep dish pizza!  Zack and I ordered the smallest pie - 10"", with pepperoni, onions, and sausage.  That's only $15 which is pretty affordable for a dinner for two (plus a few drinks while you're waiting).  

The pizza was delicious!  They layer in the toppings so that in one bite you get dough, sauce, toppings, cheese, another layer of dough and then more toppings, sauce, and cheese.  We usually take a couple slices home.",2009-10-27 21:18:45

Black Thorn has a good looking pie, cooked well, not too soupy.  Lots of toppings, and the crust is tasty BUT... that sauce???  If you actually look at it, you can see it's around 50/50 tomato and spices.  The spices are not good.  It's way too much and you can't taste anything else, which is a shame because everything else seems superior to most pizza joints.

And, I will say, this company clearly has no quality control from the local providers to the corporate office.  Here is the review we originally posted about the local provider ADCO United in Crystal Lake, IL followed by our updates until resolution.

10/11 - The worst experience!  We still keep thinking  we are being punked, but so far no cameras or big laughs.   The movers used our items without permission.  I actually saw one of the guys riding down the street on my husband's bike.  The same guy told us he was underpaid.  Another told us about his DUIs.  They wanted us to sign documentation noting damage of our items AFTER they loaded the truck and drove it away, making it just a bit difficult to inspect.  Our items arrived with damage as heavy items were packed with fragile pieces.  We now have broken crystal, plates, glasses, figurines, etc.  Furniture was also damaged.  Paperwork was missing and so was our queen bed, 10 ft ladder and a couple smaller items.  We did receive the bed the next day as it was delivered to the wrong place.  We are STILL waiting for them to deliver the ladder.  It's been about 2.5 months since the initial delivery (middle of July).  We were told they were too busy to bring it to us -- seriouslyl!   As for the other items and damages -- no resolution there either.  Just a lot of excuses.   They've even attempted to blame us for their mistakes.  Fortunately for us the documentation showed differently..  In speaking with our contact at ADCO today, he told me that he felt we were not waiting for anything - even after I reminded him about the repairs, ladder and claim check we are still waiting to receive.  When I asked if  he felt they deserved the money we paid,  he said he does.  "" We are beyond disappointment.  We know things happen, but certainly not this frequently and then for such little effort to be put forth to correct the problems is really just adding insult to injury. This may be the best example of the worst attitude toward customers ever.

UPDATE 11/4 - We were told by UNITED corporate that they were working on our claim at the beginning of October and we'd soon see resolution.  The corporate contact seemed sympathetic and shocked by our situation. Surprise!  It's a month later and our local contact told us corporate would resolve the claim this week.  I contacted corporate and you probably can guess, we saw no resolution this week.  In fact, they will not even tell us when it will be resolved.  I even offered to help with any additional info they may need from us.  PLEASE NOTE - I strongly encourage everyone to post under the corporate office in Missouri.  They go under Unigroup.  Also, contact the Better Business Burea.  Somehow these guys have an excellent rating.  I know there were allegations of the BBB selling ratings, but I would still like to think they will not ignore all the complaints out there.

FINAL UPDATE12/21 - We finally received the majority of our claim.  After going up the food chain yet again at corporate, we finally came to a settlement.  Whatever you do, do NOT give up and keep moving up the food chain until you get to someone who is not simply in place to serve as a roadblock.. It appears they set up a system that they hope will tire people out so they do not have to take responsibility and pay for the damages they cause.  And for those who have NOT used United yet, simply don't do it!",2011-11-02 18:43:02

The menu looked exactly the same so I was assuming I was going to get the same pizza. Of course I got the Chicago stlye which is just ridiculous but that's the whole point.

That being said it's still a great pizza. Takes about an hour to get but this isn't the place to come in for a quick bite. They had a good beer selection at decent prices, staff was friendly, and overall had a nice vibe. Bathrooms were disgusting though.

Others had sat down after us and gotten food before us.   I got my entree salad first and after a few minutes the two fish sandwiches came out.  Then 10-15 minutes after that my daughter got her pasta.   By the time she got it, she was crying, and  I had mostly finished my salad.   We had inquired a few times with our server about her dish and eventually told us the kitchen lost the ticket.  My son was told mayo would be on the side of his fish sandwich, but we had to ask for it.   Also has to ask for cheese for the pasta.     

The food was greasy in general.   I had low expectations and they met them.  The Mediterranean couscous salad had a little couscous but mostly salad greens.   It was very oily and over dressed.   The salad was supposed to have Parmesan cheese, but I couldn't find any.  Not a big surprise.   The fish sandwich was fried (ok) but the bread was extra buttered (very greasy).

I was also very pleased they offered a gluten-free bun-most restaurants have not yet caught on that you could carry gluten-free bread and still not have a gluten-free kitchen necessarily. Often people are sensitive to gluten not all are allergic to gluten.  The only downside is it's very small and most seating is communal. We'll go later after lunch the next time!

The booth was comfortable and we found the taps at every table very interesting - especially fun for those who like beer.  The interior is filled with largeflat screen TV's everywhere you look. I will admit I personally do not like this in any restaurant.  The place has a strong sports bar and restaurant vibe.  

The menu was fairly typical for this kind of a place.  My daughter ordered the Tuna Taco's which came with rice and beans and my wife and I split the Brisket Natchos.  The natchos were a 5 on a 10 point scale and the tuna a 7.  The brisket on the natchos was fatty and was not cooked for service.  The portion of chips was generous but the rest of the ingredients were skimpy.  They need to up their game - smoke the brisket or cook it rare and prep it on a flattop for service the way you would for a great philly cheese.  The tuna tacos were decent - nothing to get excited about but certainly acceptable.  We'd wished we had gone to Nacho Mama's.

The service was good and our waited was very nice.  

The bill was $28.73 before tax.

Will we return - probably not.

This is one of those places that more people should know about.  Sure, everyone's been to Pi, but you haven't had deep dish 'til you've tried Black Thorn's version of it. The sauce? Spicy. The toppings? They load 'em up. Cheese? Plentiful. Get your fork and knife ready. Oh, and before I forget: it's stuffed crust too. Has the mere thought of this creation conjured up images of entering a blissful food coma? It should.

What I like about Black Thorn is that it is more of a bar that happens to serve pizza, than an Italian restaurant. No ambiance here, just grit and great food (oh, and a shuffleboard table!) So, you can certainly order carry out, or if you'd like, call up and order your pizza in advance so that it's almost ready when you and your friends arrive for some beers. They take about 30-40 mins to cook.

In closing- if you like deep dish pizza, check out Black Thorn. Their take on pizza is a lot different than Pi or your typical Giordano's/Gino's, but delicious in its own way.",2012-07-03 18:43:44

As long as you don't come here with overinflated hopes about great customer service you should be in the clear, because the pizza is pretty awesome. Sure, the back room of the bar looks like an abandoned subway tunnel 200 years after the nukes fell, but so what? It's really freeing every once in a while to just let it all hang out in a place with pretty much no expectations.

Back to the issue of customer service...I've gotta say that I came in with a chip on my shoulder and my fingers crossed...mainly due to Christine's experience (yikes) and the fact that the first time I went there (which was at 1 pm on a Saturday) they were closed. What bar is freakin' CLOSED on Saturday afternoon?? Does not compute.

Anyway, once we got inside everything was coming up roses. There was a creepy middle-aged couple playing tons of Aerosmith and GnR on the jukebox, Animal Planet on the TV, and a girl with Justin Bieber's haircut behind the bar. All was right with the world.

We ordered a Chicago style pie with a whole mess of toppings and retired to the back room to occupy ourselves with Cricket and Galaga. Our pizza took about 30 or 40 minutes, announced by a bullhorn hanging from the wall. So yeah, don't come here if you're in a superbig hurry or if having your name called through a bullhorn reminds you of the police. My advice is to occupy yourself trying to hit the dartboard with behind-the-back throws while you wait.

I want to say I loved the pizza, because it really WAS good and thick with toppings, but all the cheese on top was burned all the way around the edge. =( 5 stars if the cheese isn't burned on top, that's all I'm sayin. $22 for a 12 inch deep dish with 4 toppings.

My OW referral course was excellent. Diane helped with set up the course and with my initial purchases, and she was fantastic. I took the theory and confined dives with Scott and Matt, both of whom were consummate professionals. I did my nitrox with Scott, and I've bought gear from him and Phil. All of these people were amazing, and I'd give 6 stars if I could just for the customer service this shop offers. 

The two shops (more on that below) are fully stocked with quality gear, and they can order stuff for you from several companies if they don't carry it. I haven't gone on any of their dive trips, but I signed up for their emails and it looks like they offer several to exotic locations throughout the year. They also have a couple dogs running around the west county shop. It's basically how a good small, locally owned business should run.

I had an Omelet, the back pieces inside were whole and tasted as if they were cooked a few hours earlier and then reheated in a microwave before going on my Omelet. It was not good quality, as I see they hide ones with fat pieces inside. My other problem was that I was only served 2 ketchup packets when asked. The one redeeming quality was that the portion was a decent size, even though cheese on would cost extra.

I was going to give this place 2 stars because it's an airport restaurant for breakfast, so I did not expect much to begin with.

A few months ago, my husband and I had to move on very short notice, and having recently had our first baby, we had neither the time nor energy (nor sleep) to deal with the details of packing and moving our stuff.  Adding to the issue, I still own things I had back in elementary school.  I will, however, argue that the cowboy Barbie with the red chaps will come in handy someday.

We hired United Van Lines to pack and move our things to our new place in Seattle.  The two person packing team showed up 30 minutes late, and the leader immediately asked to use our bathroom.  (In San Francisco, some of the older homes have split bathrooms - toilet in one room, sink and shower in another.)  Well, the he went in and used the toilet, then came out and went straight to work TOUCHING EVERYTHING WE OWN without washing his hands in the adjacent sink room.

Eeeeeeuuuuuwwww!  Wee-wee cooties all over everything.

Later, I walked in to the bedroom while they worked and saw Mr. Toilet Hands pawing through the drawers which held my delicate under things.  He said he was ""checking for heavy things"".  I noticed that he did less thorough ""checking"" in my husband's dresser.  Again, I say... euw.

Also, things arrived broken, scratched, and generally mishandled.  Scheduling was a complete nightmare and the lead mover (different than the lead packer) was rather incompetent, repeatedly forgetting to call to update us on their progress, leading to more than one occasion in which we sat for hours waiting for them to arrive.

I'll start by saying that their Chicago Style is definitely not for everyone. There is a TON of cheese and the sauce has a lot of what I'm assuming is oregano (which I love) so I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea. I personally love their pizza but it's definitely something I would only eat once in awhile because it is SO filling. Like I ate it for dinner last night and it's now lunchtime the next day and I'm still full... I wasn't even able to finish two slices after running a freaking marathon.

The reason I only gave Black Thorn 3 stars is because of the service and wait time. I've never physically eaten there but every time I've called, the person answering the phone has been pretty rude. It's gotten to the point where I dread calling the order in. And I get that the insanely long wait time is kind of Black Thorn's ""thing"" but cmon now... Last night we ordered at exactly 5 o'clock on the dot when they opened and still waited an hour and a half. That is INSANE. I'm assuming unless people put their orders in a day in advance, our order is one of the first they had upon opening. I literally can't conceive of one reason why it would take one pizza an hour and a half to cook... I worked at a small (but very busy) pizza place in Chicago that only had myself and two other employees working at a time and we would get deep dishes out in 40 minutes MAX. It wouldn't even take an hour and a half on Super Bowl Sunday, so I don't know what their excuse is.  When my husband went in to pick it up last night, he said that people were being told two hours and were calling to cancel their orders. Long story short: I get it, your pizza is good...

Update 2: Got a regular with spicy tuna. This time I actually had a lot of fish left over (and they were willing to give me a scoop of rice to help me eat it). I suspect the first time I went I was only given one of my two scoops. Regular size was enough to fill me.

Awesome to see a poke place! Would give it like a 3.5, because not enough food for the price and their fish to rice ratio was unsatisfying. I may have only received one scoop of fish though...

Environment: clean, good menu, and well-staffed so far. Choose your options at the counter style.

Size: smaller than I was expecting. $8 for a small: like a cup and a half of rice or noodles and maybe 1.5-2 tablespoons of fish. Just seeing them scoop the fish with their tiny scoop is depressing, even if you get a decent amount of fish in the end. At least the toppings were plentiful. They fill about 2/3 their bowl size, which makes it easy to stir but sad to eat. Still kinda hungry after their small; think you need to order a medium at least for $10.

Taste: yum! things taste good, nice and flavorful, and their spicy tuna had a pleasant afterburn.  Can't say anything about the freshness of the fish because only ordered spicy tuna and shrimp. They also have tofu. Base poke sauce is a sweet soy. A tad oversauced for my soba noodles but about right for the rice. 

Options: Good selection of carbs, fish, and especially toppings and sauces. Toppings include fried onions (crunch!), mango, pineapple, crab (for more meat), fish eggs (masago), seaweed salad (yum), and avocado for extra $.

Pearl milk tea: Ordered a green tea and it was brown; I think it was a generic milk tea? Decent flavor but cup was about 1/3 ice so it was gone really fast for $5. Good pearls.",2017-10-30 23:17:50

We had seen the relatively good yelp reviews and were looking forward to trying somewhere new, it seems like the city has been loosing good Asian style fare for the past decade, so I am hopeful when a new place gives it a shot.

On the upside the whole staff there was relatively friendly and attended to us right away. They have a patio and I do like to sit outside in nice weather, it did not look like they allowed smoking outside so that is an even BIGGER plus. Unfortunately, this is all I can say to their favor.

The inside appeared sparsely decorated and was not welcoming or comfortable so I was even happier that there was outdoor seating.

The menu is simple, maybe too simple? But ok and rolled with it. 

It was a build your own Pad-Thai or pho or Asian wrap. We and started with apps. I wanted Crab Rangoon and my wife ordered wantons. My CRs were cooked well, but the filling was very bland. They brought my wife what I would call ""crispy noodles"" covered in powdered sugar. When we asked why we received a desert, the waitress was like ""oh..those are our wantons"".

Uh..ok. She explained that other people had mentioned that app won-tons were ""maybe a thing in St. Louis""....Yep... Look I love experimentation, but it would have helped if they had a blurb on the menu. 

I had a Pad Thai w chicken & avocado, egg, tomato, sweet pepper & broccoli. My wife had tofu, tomato, egg, spinach and snow peas. Let's just say they lapsed on the details. 

HINT: make a little cheat sheet for your waitstaff to use so they don't forget stuff. Memorizing an order may seem cool and hip, but screwing it up makes you look silly.

But to conclude, and most importantly: The food was bland and tasteless. It killed them to put a piece of snow pea on a dish? I do not want to go further as the rest of the meal was disappointing. I ate because I was hungry, but was glad to leave.

Clearly this restaurant is off to a poor start and I did not get the impression it would get better.

Served nice and hot, smoky, a creaminess. Not an authentic gumbo, but good. Wished we had some authentic French bread! Next, jambalaya! Lots of rice, andouille sausage, minimal shrimp and chicken. It needed more protein and seasoning. The best dish, was the chicken and waffle. The chicken was moist, well seasoned and was drizzled with a cayenne pepper sauce. The chicken rested on a delicious waffle! Crispy. It was the winner of the 3 dishes we tried! One problem with the restaurant was the noise! We arrived early, very few tables, but very loud.

Currently I'm moving from CT to AZ and while doing research almost every shipping company has negative reviews which I think is unfair if you don't give them credit when they executed the order as per your expectations.

Pickup: I told them they have to either come before 9 or after 5 but this guy calls me up at 11 when I was at work. Thank god it wasn't a busy day for me. I took one of mycolleague and went to my place. It was a towing truck. He told me that they would be collecting the cars for dispatch and dispatch from central location. I would have asked him to come to my work had I known that it was a pickup truck.

Drop off: It took  5 days before to reach CT. Since my company booked rental car for 2 weeks, I didn't care about the time frame. The driver called me the previous day and gave me a 2hr window. On staurday morning, he drove to an empty parking lot which is a block away from my hotel. It was a closed container. The driver was very polite.

We had no problems with damages, the moving truck arrived at both location when promised, the actual hauler Chris from Denver was the best.  There is not one negative thing we could say.

We ordered the following:
Rick's Famous Fried Chicken (Half, Not Hot) - Very tasty and juicy fried chicken. The seasoning was great and the breading thickness was just right. No complaints.
STL-Style Pork Ribs (Third) - This was my favorite for the night. Fall off the bone ribs with a raw sugar glaze. If you haven't tried this, I highly recommend it.
Cracklin Corn Bread - Not terribly impressed by the cornbread. Wasn't as moist as I expected.
Macaroni + Cheese - St. Louis has some insanely good mac n cheese, Unfortunately this wasn't one to top my list.
Grilled Carrots + Onions - My favorite side for the nice. The carrots had a great texture to them, not mushy and not too hard.
Caramelized Leek Soup - Soup had really great flavor. Definitely would get this again.

3FI3qLaLP9NEcGuKxXPMBw,M4yFvtrNL-zuK7UXlREUCg,JgTSG4rIDf20Kgp6U_asng,4,2,0,0,"First off, I'll admit I'm a sucker for thick pizza and low key bars.  Black Thorn delivers on both.

Black Thorn may have topped the list as my favorite pizza in St. Louis.  Their Chicago Style is amazing - thick and doughy crust with crispy edges, gobs of gooey (non-provel) cheese, and smokey marinara sauce.  Extremely satisfying and a few slices will fill you for days.  Yes, as other reviewers have commented it may not be classic ""Chicago"" style with a second thin layer of crust on top - when I've had similar styles before it's been called ""stuffed"" pizza  -  but it's still great.  

I called my order in ahead of time pretty early on a Friday night and would recommend anyone else do the same, otherwise I'd have been waiting with nothing to eat for 75 minutes.  Wait times can be anywhere from 40  mins to 1 hr 30 mins.  Calling ahead can ensure you're not standing around waiting with no place to sit.  They do have carry out service so that's always an option.

That's another thing: the interior adds to this place's charm but also stops it from getting a better review.  Seating is very limited and there aren't really servers so when some couples sit, they'll stay seated.  I love the atmosphere the bar has, too.  A single ~30"" tv, old beer cans, an old porch style overhang, and generally old decorations.  Old regulars sit at the bar yelling at the Cardinals game while an odd mix of hipsters, yuppies, and hoosiers enjoy old bar/arcade games and cheap beer.  It's just eclectic and fun. 

The outside face is completely unassuming. You can hardly tell this place serves food if you didn't read up before hand.  It's far enough off Grand to keep street parking fairly easy and groups of bar hoppers avoid it as it's off the strip.  

I'd recommend Black Thorn to people looking for a relaxing evening and some different, good pizza.  Don't go in expecting great service or the best ran restaurant and you won't be disappointed.  Rather than thinking of it as a restaurant, think of Black Thorn more as a cheap bar that happens to have a kitchen.",2014-08-23 18:34:20

You order your calzone and drink, then seat yourself with a strange card to receive your meal from the servers, and somehow the staff knows to bring ""you"" the food you ordered. That was impressive.

My sister ordered The Fold (with pepperoni) and really didn't like it. Her quote was, ""the best part of my meal was the Red Bull."" Yikes! She really didn't like the ricotta cheese that's added to the calzones and said it messed up the texture of the dish for her. Also, neither of us liked the flavor of the marinara on the side. It tasted like some basic store-bought Ragu sauce with a few added unneccessary seasonings.

As for me, I had the Roasty Toasty and wasn't much of a fan. I should've ordered something different but it was my first time here. The pesto on the side was cold which was strange to me and I would've preferred it to be served warmer.

At this point, we are beyond frustrated and extremely disappointed in United Van Lines, and I think it's necessary for others to hear our experience before choosing a moving company.  

We used them for our recent move from Kansas to Texas and ran into problem after problem.  The first issue was that they gave us a one week window in which they would deliver our belongings, then did not deliver them until 6 days after the window closed.  Upon arrival, we had several items damaged.  

Just to name a few:
-Our washing machine is completely broken.  The knob snapped in half, and parts are loose inside of the washer itself.
-A large chunk is taken out of our antique, wooden buffet table from England.  There is also a piece completely missing on the front.  This upsets more than most since it is impossible to replace.
-A chunk of the wooden leg on our couch is missing.
-The bottom drawer of our wooden filing cabinet is completely broken and appears something got knocked through it.

Note that the people who loaded and unloaded our belongings at our homes were all wonderful and careful.  They were not employees of United Van Lines but third party moving companies.  
United told us that everything was unloaded off of the original truck and then loaded into large wooden crates before bringing them to Texas for our local company to move.  It is obvious that the United employees who loaded/reloaded our belongings were completely careless.

While we are able to make claims for these items, it is extremely frustrating and not all of the items can be replaced.  

I strongly advise you to choose another company.",2017-12-11 01:27:25

I can offer insight to their pizza.  The Chicago-style pizza that Black Thorn offers is the best Chicago-style pizza I have ever had in St. Louis.  

On their pizza pie, their sauce is spicy and sweet.  They have mounds and mounds of cheese on and in the pizza.  When we order, we just tell them what we want on it and they come through.  My norm is sausage, onions, and mushrooms.  They do not skimp on the toppings.  Do not expect a puny pizza.

  Keeping my promise to not review within 48 hours of a visit, I have given this some thought, over the last few days.

  I stopped in the first week they opened. It was clean and the staff were nice. They were pretty well prepared and reacted pretty well to my indecision and ignorance.

  If you like the SoCal stuff, then this will be a bit different for you and maybe not as familiar but I found it to be more ""Hawaiian"" and therefore more authentic and not ""Americanized"" as much... the rice was starchy, which shows it was not over processed. The fish was very fresh. I only did lunch there (twice), so I did not see shortfalls in inventory that some of the other people have mentioned but I am thinking that since this place is new, they are still getting a feel for how quickly the types of their product move. I think I would rather eat at a fish restaurant that runs out of things, rather than seeing them try to stretch the meats out for another two or three days. 

  If I were in Kona, I might give this place a 4... you just can't beat the freshness and of course being in the Islands but the quality is excellent and I was pleasantly surprised.

We paid over $9,000 to the agreed services of Morgan Transfer (affiliated with United) and trusted their contract and customer reviews to safely and timely deliver our belongings. 

 This was our experience:

1- No communication from the Office on the day of when the movers were picking up our belongings

2- On the day prior to the last day of our delivery window, we were informed our items had not left Washington.  It took a total of 18 days to move our belongings from WA to MI.  They did reimburse us $500 for the inconvenience, which did not even cover our hotel costs or extra meal costs due to having to eat out everyday.

3- 2 checkbooks were stolen from our file cabinet during the move and two fraudulent checks were made out of my account for a total of $990.  Given the large expense to move, out of pocket hotel/food expenses, this was extremely stressful.  We called and notified Morgan Transfer of the incident, and received no follow up on the matter.  We escalated the issue to United Van Lines corporate team, but have yet to learn of any developments.

4- They lost all of our silverware, which was valued at over $400 and was a wedding gift to us from September.  We contacted Dawn 3 times about the check and silverware, and she forwarded the information to the claim department.  It's been a week and a half and still no response.  A  request was also sent in to corporate and denied because of a BS waiver that the driver has you sign when they deliver your items.  If you'd like to have the driver and movers stay on your property to check off hundreds of items and boxes (took us almost a week to unpack and to fully realize what was missing) then defiantly make that choice.  We were rushed to sign our paperwork, not properly explained the pages and were told everything was taken care of and to contain the local office with any questions or concerns that come up.  We also paid for the insurance of our items- not sure what the insurance was for since they won't actually cover anything.  Again, just another way to be taken advantage of.

I could continue on with several damaged items and other missing items (such as our bed screws- so nice to finally get your belongings after such a long wait, but still no functioning bed!).  I expected things to be damaged or things to go wrong- it's a big move. I wasn't expecting things to go wrong at this magnitude and for the company to do nothing to help out their customer, besides doing the bare minimum. 


So moral of the story, if you like to be stolen from, taken advantage of, and partner with crooks (not to mention pay an arm and a leg for a service) then book Morgan Transfer.  We've moved across the country two times before without any issues from Allied.  Can't say I'll be trusting any van lines after this experience. I know it's a lot of work, but if you can, consider doing the move yourself.  Definitely do not hire Morgan Transfer/United.


*****Update to Review******
Since posting this review on Yelp, we were contacted by United regarding this issues listed above. Shelly from customer service was very helpful and we were fully reimbursed for the missing items and were told that there was an ongoing investigation regarding the theft that was being taken seriously.  I was happy to hear this information- as I hope no one else has to go through this experience.  Being reimbursed for the missing items was also a huge relief to the financial burdens we were facing from the move.  I feel that United did address all of my concerns, which I do appreciate.   A couple of other positives to add to this review: none of our fragile wedding gifts were broken.  The packing team really did do a great job ensuring those items were securely packed.  Although we had the theft issue, the employees that we had direct contact during the move process were very friendly and professional to work with.  I know the majority of them did not steal from us, and deserve credit for their hard work and customer service.",2018-07-12 16:29:34

If i could give this salon 0 stars, I would. I have always kept my hair short, but the last couple of years, I have grown it long. I went in to get it cut back to my usual just-shorter-than-shoulder length style. I showed the stylist multiple pictures of myself, at the length I wanted, both curly and straight. I stressed to her that I wanted to be able to wear my hair straight and curly. She assured me that she could make it look 'great.' Well, she failed. I walked out of the salon with a jaw-length A-line cut, shorter on one side. Awful, awful, awful. I walked out of the salon and immediately started crying. I went home to straighten it, hoping it would grow on me, but it just got worse. The back is SO choppy, with awful, blunt layers, and there is a whole section that is just missing.

He thoroughly explained what he was going to do and then he did it. He reported back that he found 8 (!!!!!) wasp nests around our property and a dead mouse and we discussed pest control services for our little rodent friends. We were really pleased with him. Very friendly and polite, not overbearing. 

So why the three stars?

The sales guy who visited our house to get us to schedule service was very grating - probably just an age factor. He was what you think of when you think of a typical door-to-door sales guy. Our municipal police drove by while he was talking to us (apparently, someone in our neighborhood called on him for soliciting; he had the required permits though) and the kid was bragging with to us about how he's so cool with our officers and was trying to show us that he took pictures with the officers from when he's been called on before. It was pretty immature and a waste of our time. Then, he, for whatever reason, could just NOT get my husband's very normal name spelled correctly in the email address so we could receive the documents; I think hubs spelled his name 4 times for the kid. 

Also, the time he rang was borderline inappropriate for us. We have a 1 year old and he was really cutting it close to her bed time. And, according to him, he still needed 4 more households to sign up in order to meet his quota (yes, he told us that too, and bragged that 4 more should be easy....at 7:30 in the evening....when families are settling down for family time and bed time).

The kid's lucky we were already considering pest control services and that we like a good deal. 

Anyhow. The service guy was great. And if the results are good and continue to be good, we'll keep it up - with the hopes that we never have to deal with a sales guy again.",2018-05-24 01:25:43

The ""Steak-burger"" can be greasy at times, but it is made from a combo of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks and is NOT the grade D beef, that most fast food restaurants serve.
Chili 5-way is a heart attack waiting to happen, but oh so yummy

United Van Lines was contracted by my employer for our move. Our stuff was picked up on 6/6/14 in Boston but took at least 12 days (6/18/14) to leave Boston (not yet confirmed if it has left as of today, 6/18). I called multiple times starting on 6/9/14 to see if and when we had a driver assigned to our load; when told that the anticipated driver would not leave until 6/19, I asked if our load could be given to another driver. Supposedly this was offered to other drivers and declined; but, when I asked for the reasons it was declined, the customer service rep said they were not listed. When I brought up with customer service that our delivery would likely be late (latest delivery date 6/21/14), they did not seem interested in trying to address how to rectify this. They merely talked about their standard delay claims and offering us a ""generous"" additional $200 to pay for a bed and toys for my son. The multiple email and phone conversations we have had are empty and say nothing--there have been a lot of apologies and words but no action. I get the sense that given the standard delay claims, it is cheaper for United Van Lines to delay a shipment so that the freight is full; that is, there is little (if any) financial incentive for them to deliver on time. In speaking with their customer service representatives, I was told that there was a shortage of drivers, which is why our shipment is delayed. Although they claim that they are trying to address this situation, they seem incapable of accounting for this in their delivery estimates. My son and I are flying into Seattle on 6/21, the supposed last date of delivery. When I emailed and asked why they gave us the delivery window they did, I did not receive a reply.I have been trying to work with the company to see how we might get our load into Seattle on time, but this is not their priority.",2014-06-19 04:10:01

I now believe every word written about United by the other 1 star reviewers because we too, have lived it. We experienced an excellent move from Maine to Florida but the move from Florida to California was an absolute disaster. First, with full knowledge of the weight of the contents as represented by their estimator, the company arranged to send us a driver who could only take part of the load on a cross country move but didn't inform us of that until he finished loading what he could into the truck. He then had to move all the items he spread out in driveway to the garage. The company then sent another truck to load the remainder of the items. That second load did not reach us until a couple weeks later. Many of the items were disassembed and parts were lost. We also incurred substantial damage to a number of items and a box was lost entirely. Since we only took the standard insurance (relying on the success of the Maine to Florida move) we got screwed big time. The coup de grace was the claims process. Here we are, one year later and still waiting for the final claims check. The first check was negated by their system for whatever reason and would have remained unaccounted for if I had not followed up. The claims person apologized and promised to send out another check overnight. Well, here we are three days later and no check. Why am I not surprised. I would not deal with this company again if my life depended on it.

Had been waiting to visit for around 6 years since I first saw her standing forlornly along Morganford.  Many an old timer told me I'd love it, but I knew when the time was right I'd finally get around to it.

Clean, spacious, lots of big screens, Golden Tee, Internet Jukebox, A Bud Fan clock (timeless) and even a framed ""Who"" album cover.  My kind of place.  There was a decent late lunch crowd so I knew we were going to enjoy.

Each day has a special, with Friday being ""Fish"" or on that particular day, shrimp.  

I was hungering for a good old fashioned burger and find it I did.  For $8.50 I got the Haven Burger which was 1/2 pound on a very fresh bun with 3 cheeses (cheddar/swiss/provel) and two strips of very nice bacon.  The fries were crinkle cut and piping hot.  Delicious.

I love private kitchen, and we've been waiting for this place to open for months, so we can eat crab roe pork soup dumplings whenever the craving hits. Ever since the owner said it's opening asap, I have been driving into the plaza whenever I'm nearby to see if it's finally happened, always ready to devour an order or two on the spot. 

And you should definitely go. But if you expect a perfect experience, give them some time. The place still smells a little like paint, the decorations are kind of sparse and they're serving you on little disposable paper plates, and everything including the credit card machine is next door so they still have to work on efficiency.

 The display case is still pretty empty with sides, and if you expect to eat a big meal for a reasonable price, you need to wait for them to work out their rhythm a bit. Otherwise, and order of 6 small soup dumplings is $8, and some come in an order of 8 for $9-12, and 2 people can easily spend $50 after tax tip to not be super full. They don't skimp on the meat, and it can get heavy quickly, but it's not exactly a complete meal without some accompaniments, which I hope will populate the case in the near future. 

I didn't care much about that and I'll def be back after everything is 100% - just had to try soup dumplings asap. They had 6 options on a piece of paper taped to the wall, but only 4 (pork chicken beef pork/crab) were available. No crab roe pork on the menu ;(

And I mean, the flavor was real good. Each meat tasted like the animal itself, and you got a nice chunk in each bao. The soupiness was inconsistent though, and that's a little unsatisfying and disappointing. Probably because in bigger scale production the soup gel isn't distributed as evenly into the filling mix? I don't know. About half of ours were as soupy and satisfying as the private kitchen crab roe pork dumplings. But again, opening kinks. 

Can't wait to see what it becomes in the future! But if you insist on going now, just beware of setting your expectations too high for the little details during what is really still soft opening stages.",2017-09-25 14:56:02

I guess the positive is the sales associate, Scott was very nice, informative and seemed to genuinely care. Unfortuantely, there was nothing he could do about the blunder that had unfolded. We had to store our belongings for 3 months, therefore, the move out of storage to our new location was where everything went wrong. Lets start with the fact we moved during the slowest moving season and yet our load was divided into two loads. I am not sure how they thought over 9500 pounds was going to fit into 12 feet left on a truck. The agent called and told me that they were going to ship the 2nd load and have it there the same day. Then the day before arrival they informed me that they changed the plans and my second load would not arrive until over a week later (was not even given an exact date at this time and it was going to be way out of their contracted delivery window).  Since I was out of town for work at the time this meant I needed to buy another flight and rent another car to be there for the second move because if I wasnt then I was informed they would charge me over $4000/day for storage. When my first delivery came there was 21 pieces damaged, most were unrepairable. It was obviously negligence that led to this as they tried to cram as much stuff as they could in the 12 feet of the truck. As an example, they snapped a metal coffee table and a solid wood leaf to a dining table. Of course there was no way of knowing what was here and what was not since half my stuff was still to be delivered. Once the second load arrived it was also noted that two high valued items were missing and supposedly on the first load. It took 2 weeks and a lot of stress to track them down. They were delivered to the wrong people. While they were willing to compensate for the exact value of the damage (not replacement value), there was no reimbursment offered for the delay or the extra costs I had to incur to be there for the second delivery. Not only that, but the aloof attitude of ""Sorry, these things happen"" was extremely frustrating. When my claim was esculated to United Vanlines the customer service rep there (Diane) was downright rude. Telling me that if I thought for a minute they were going to pay for my flight and rental I was mistaken. They finally, after many weeks of frustration, agreed as a ""Good Will Gesture"" to add an additional $400 onto my reimbursement.  Mind you this was a very expensive, cross country move.  The attitude I was given was not acceptable. These were my possessions that I have worked hard for and the attitude was ""Oh Well, it happens"". I asked to know that the responsilble parties, such as the operations manager that originally okay'd my load to go onto the first truck,  were disciplined. I was told by one of their own employees that all this was avoidable, that my stuff should have never went on that first truck in the first place. How do you damage 21 pieces of furniture and it not be considered grossly negligent. United Vanlines of course is a huge company and obviously protects the individual companies so the individual customer doesnt have a chance to fight them. You are just expected to accept whatever happens and also pay in full for it. They should be ashamed to even call themselves a customer service department. They do not serve the customer they serve the big company that is untouchable.",2018-05-15 15:07:11

It is a short drive from my office in Des Peres.  There was plenty of parking.  The inside of the restaurant was another story. It was packed, but this is to be expected on a weekday around noon.  Luckily, I was placing my order to go so a lack of seating didn't matter to me today.

I looked over the menu and chose The Daily Bread Special sandwich.  This sandwich features roast beef, ham, salami, provel cheese (I'm a St. Louisan, what can I say? I love it), pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pepperoncinis & DB sauce on a French baguette. I am not pepperoncinis fans so I chose to forgo those.  

Uninspired is the only word that comes to mind when I think of the food.  The sandwich reminded me too much a grocery store poor boy.  The meats, cheese, and veggies were all very plain.  The bread had a great flavor, but seemed unnecessarily chewy.  As a result, each bite felt like work.  The sauce was good and probably the best part of the sandwich.  

While I wasn't thrilled with this meal, I will likely return and try something else from the menu.  They had a good selection of salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  So who knows, I may find something I like next time.",2010-10-27 02:49:03

The plus? I revealed a mop of naturally curly hair that I LOVE.

So I went to Frontenac Salon and Spa. They have a few stylists that specialize in cutting and styling curly hair (they specialize in the ""Deva"" cutting method), and after doing a lot of research, I decided to book with Jamie.

She was SUPER friendly. She told me exactly everything she was doing, exactly what products she was using and how to use them -- and she did all of this without trying to push products on me to purchase -- a huge plus. She even offered me tea while I was sitting underneath the dryer!

We sat at the bar because, on a Friday night, it was hoppin' at 7PM, and seating was limited. Still, the bar was nice, and the service friendly and accommodating!

First, a brilliantly curated wine list and carefully crafted cocktails, then onto some flavor-effusive appetizers. We had the hominy hush puppies, the dirty rice, and the greens, each one making our tastebuds sing. The hush puppies were perfectly crisp on the outside, tender and decadent on the inside. The cucumber sauce added a creamy dimension of garden freshness. The dirty rice had a tangy onion zesty-ness to it that had my fork diving in again and again. The greens accented with peppers gave them an unexpected boost.

If the apps were this incredible, we couldn't wait for the entree! Nathan, our awesome bartender/server highly recommended the fried chicken and cornbread waffles, so I ordered that. What I received was a ""Dolly Cluckton""- sized breast atop a firm and flavorful cornbread waffle, with a dollop of butter, and syrup and hot sauce on the side for as little or as much dowsing as I pleased. I used about half of the small bottle of hot sauce and most of the mini ramekin of syrup. The chicken was perfection - just tender enough to be able to absorb the sauce throughout. It was so delicious, I kept eating and eating, getting through about half of the enormous breast before my stomach called ""Uncle.""

And where else do you have a restaurant where almost everyone orders just one sandwich...that is just meat on a bun. Yes, it's that good. 

The fries are good too. I like them with the seasoned salt or a side of cheese sauce if I'm feeling thin that day.

MZ2mVmWHcG7rU2-MhR82dQ,BOGfFalncFhGJk_BQVC8YQ,0z45rM2paE-O-6w63GEi6g,1,14,1,0,"Moved from NY to SC United (which works with Mayflower and Armstrong relocation services under UNIGROUP) was the company that was hired by my hospital to move me (I am a physician). I unfortunately only mostly  cons here to report

I'll get this out of the way for now: PROs: They were polite at first. And actually very efficient in packing my things for my move while I was there to watch them (see below for further details). 

Pre Move: They were completely unorganized. I have a number of pieces of glass furniture and repeatedly told them about the sizes and number of items that I had that required crating (this means they would pack the glass items separately and more securely for the move). This was done by a 3rd party person. The 3rd party was great, but he was told I had 1 piece of glass. And had to go out and find more wood to crate only a few of my items. 

They had scheduled a time to come to pick my things up prior to me going to work. And they showed up 3 hours late. I understand that traffic and schedules change, but when I left for work (because they were late and I had to then go and leave them there), my roommate came an hour later and found them DRINKING HIS BEER WHILE MOVING MY STUFF. And their excuse was me saying before I left, if you get hot you can help yourself to drinks in the fridge, I had meant water, soda etc. I didn't realize that United, and Armstrong condoned drinking while on the job. 

When I got to SC my stuff came late. So the third party movers who were there for mounting my TV and putting together surround sound etc, they were waiting by themselves and then left. My items then came the next day. 

Everything had been broken. The boxes were smashed to bits. My dresser was barely able to stand upright. My glass desk was missing pieces. My glass dining table had a cracked base that someone had placed tape over. The estimated cost of everything to replace was around 8000 dollars. My bed had no support beams. Just some wood around it (I had to build a makeshift support for my boxspring and mattress). My bookshelf had the back smashed in because a box went through it. I had missing dining ware, no plates or silverware. 

I was furious. I made a claim, because the claim was over 5000, they bumped the claim to United. From here they sent a claims adjuster, who claimed that my dresser, which again i mention COULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT, seemed like it must have been in this condition before I moved it. I'm not sure, how he thought I would agree that I must have just moved trash down from NY, but he seemed to be trying to convince me of that. As usual they did their best to cheapen their deal, which is their job I suppose, but here was the straw that finally broke me. 

They told me I couldn't get rid of any of the broken furniture until the settlement was finished. This process then lasted 2.5 months. I came to a new city, and had to live with broken things until they gave me my settlement. My settlement did not include any of the bigger pieces of furniture, just the small things. 

When I asked if they could fix the furniture I got no response. Customer service for the company (which you will have to call multiple companies to climb the ladder until you get to Unigroups claim center is lead by a man named Vick. Vick is the guard dog. He refused to let me talk to claims agents, stating that I had to email instead. When I asked to speak to a manager, he refused to put me through instead he made me email as well. It wasn't until I found out his name and the name of his manager did I get anywhere. 

I understand that things can happen. But the complete lack of respect for my things in all phases of this really just made this whole process terrible. The lack of coordination in the beginning, the clear damage done and the refusal of responsibility, and then the inability to speak to claims agents, all these are why it seems that United has gotten such horrible ratings on line. And I seem to be just another person who is added to this list. 

Final result: I have gotten about 3000 dollars because of the items they simply lost. 0 dollars for broken furniture that they have made me keep. I will likely be in arbitration (an extended review) in order to get this sorted out, and I am anticipating that I will have to go more of a legal route (which I don't want to but its that or give up). 

I really recommend trying to find another company if you can when you move your things. It has been an awful experience.",2015-09-15 20:02:37

But even though I ordered the wrong pizza, I still couldn't believe how bad the pizza was: it gets a solid one star. The bread to topping ratio was 9:1, and wasn't cooked through, resulting in a mushy, doughy interior. The zesty sauce couldn't make up for the bland interior, and the non-existent cheese didn't help its case. 

I read favorable reviews about the pan pizza, and assumed the Chicago and pan style were synonymous, so I ordered pan when I called in my order. I realized my mistake at the bar when I was paying, and the bartender was friendly and explained how it worked, hence the second star.  However, unless you've eaten there before and know and for some reason like their pan style pizza, DO NOT order it. 

I'm a pizza lover and appreciate all styles of pizza. However this one, not so much. I'm willing to try again and order the Chicago style pizza I'd originally hoped for.

G6g3mPR14oO3gD_ifCdn2w,MnkU6HosOLFWFm-kJKQ3zQ,MuKoTR56s6elHEI2wUkgJA,5,1,0,1,"My mom and I had a great Southern USA BBQ cuisine meal at this new, excellent restaurant in the Tower Grove neighborhood of #StLouis: 5 stars, especially for the pork ribs, friend chicken livers, tall biscuit, mashed potatoes and gravy: all site-made and fresh! Happy early #MothersDay to us!

Also, VERY clean bathrooms (ALWAYS a good sign), excellent table service. Great decor (wall hanging art was made by the female co-owner(: original, beautiful, large, collage-like sculptures made with found objects and succulents. 

NOTE: if you use the bathroom, be VERY CAREFUL opening the door to leave: that hallway is also the food-runners' aisle from the kitchen to the dining room! 

The male half of the married couple who own this new place came over to speak with us, too, so we were able to tell him how much we liked it. Since my mom is from Kentucky and has lived in St. Louis since she was 12, her opinion of Southern BBQ cuisine MATTERS! 

They offer ice, lemons, sugar and artificial sweeteners, fountain soft drinks, water, and 3 types of iced tea at a self-serve beverage center situated conveniently near but not blocking the ordering/pick-up counter.  

They get VERY busy, so highly recommend going during ""non-peak"" hours or expect to wait in line (which they've organized). But, the cooks, order-takers and food runners are friendly and move quickly with great efficiency, even though this IS ""slow food"" at its best. 

You can get the food to carry-out to home or dine-in at varied size tables, single high stools at the small counter (doubling for those waiting for carry-out, too), or outside on benches. If you dine in or outside, they give you a table marker to ID and bring your food to you.

Great, large, soft napkins and hot sauce with salt & pepper at each table. They'll bring BBQ sauce upon request, but pork ribs were great without it, too. 

Prices seemed a bit high until we realized we got enough food for two meals, each, for the cost of $41, which worked out to about $11/per meal (we tipped 10% above that, since we thought it was set up for mostly no wait service, but we were wrong: they DO have food runners, and they are VERY attentive. Next time, bigger tips!). 

So, pricing is very fair, since we got (for the total ring-up cost of $41):
--- one appetizer (enough food there for two); 
---two ""mains"" (one ""third""--4-- and one ""half""--8-- slabs of pork ribs = 12 ribs, total); 
---one VERY tall biscuit (definitely enough for 2); 
and 
---2 sides (I ate half of each for lunch and brought the rest home, since Mom didn't want any of these except to taste the mashed potatoes and gravy; she's not big on collards). .  

Only weird choice: the serving ""plates"" were actually metal and plastic trays of varied sizes. Food was well-presented, but it seemed odd to get such great food for ""dining in"" on aluminum/steel trays or plastic, cafeteria-style trays, without any plates at all. Is it supposed to be cute or do they save money on dishes or what? We didn't like that part.

Music was a bit loud (we asked them if they'd turn it down, and they did; about one notch) but fun choices ('60s-'70s USA R & B, mostly).  

Also, we aren't sure where everyone parks. We got there near 11 AM on a weekday (opening is 11 AM) and found a metered place right in front, on Tower Grove, facing North, but there are only a few spaces there. We saw no lot in back (and that was where we were, having missed in on Manchester and driven around the south side of the back lots next to it to find it) or other places for many cars. What do they do? There is an the obvious expectation of (and probably is getting to be usual for lunch or dinner) crowds! 

Very easy to get to, but we couldn't see it at first on Manchester Rd. (where its address actually is listed) because outdoor signage is lacking on that side. The restaurant is actually on the SE corner of Manchester Rd. and Tower Grove Ave.(very visible signage and benches on that side), about 1 minute's drive from the Tower Grove Ave. exit of I-64/40, very near downtown St. Louis, in the charming, up-and-coming walkable area of this neighborhood (across from Sauce). We came from West County/Creve Coeur, and it only took about 15 - 20 minutes (in non-peak traffic), door-to-door. 

HIGHLY recommended. Great website, also. THANKS, Grace Meat + Three!

I really do like this fried chicken.  The heat is pleasant, the meat has been juicy and has proper salt.  We both order a quarter, dark and it has been very good.  

For sides we have had mixed experiences.  I have had collards both times and they are good.  As with many places I eat them, they don't chop them quite enough and you end up dragging big strings of greens out of the serving container, but they have been tender and are cooked with a little smoked meat.  They don't sweeten them much (I dislike sweet greens) but they don't use any vinegar (I prefer a splash) but they are salted lightly and I will continue to order them.  Most recently I had fried cabbage.  I'm not sure why this dish is ever called fried cabbage and that is true everywhere I order it.  It is really more sautéed.  At Grace, it was almost not cooked at all and was given an Indian flair with chickpeas and a chile sauce that was laced with cumin.  It was almost curried cabbage.  Mr D tried the creamed hominy and this was not a hit for any of us.  The hominy was tasteless, there was no cream.  Ms T had some seasonal vegetables which turned out to be mostly leeks and she is not an onion eater.

I will continue to go for fried chicken and greens.  I will just have to find another side that I like.  You certainly don't need to limit yourself to fried chicken.  It is just a small part of the menu.  Grace is a welcome replacement for the infinitely overrated Sweetie Pie's.  While dining at Grace most recently, with the D's, that subject came up and we universally agreed Sweetie Pie's was the worst food we have had in St Louis.

To justify my infidelity, I'll just say, that Black Thorn and Pi are equally as amazing, but in different ways. 

I visited Black Thorn on Saturday night while catching up with family. Between 7 of us, 2 pizzas were plenty. The pie was big and loaded with toppings. The bread was thick, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the cheese was plentiful, and the sauce was perfectly seasoned with a bit of a kick. 

The atmosphere is a pretty typical dive bar, but there is a fun kitchy-ness to it with all the wall graffiti. They even have darts and shuffleboard which was a favorite among the men in the group. You order at the bar and when your food is ready, your name is called over the PA system set up in the building. Loud and obnoxious? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.   

Now, the next statement I'm going to make might have a few people gagging, but I'm not too proud to admit it:

Sometimes you just want greasy, heavy, ""not good for me"" pizza to satisfy the junkiest of junk food cravings. This was a winner.

QBhGCkut0qiPYMQWahPWmg,iwyXPwZ_BbIHMQJZqI-O6A,Z2ltNYVxmLaLGNVB7yFWQA,4,0,0,0,"I use National exclusively for one reason: Emerald Club.   With Emerald, I can choose the car with the best fit (I'm 6'6"") and if I find a car where someone has smoked in it previously (I'm allergic to cigarette/pipe/cigar smoke) - I just choose another vehicle.  

The staff isn't particularly friendly, but they at least acknowledge my presence.  

With that said, the drawbacks are plenty...  1) Although I get 'points' on my Emerald loyalty card, it takes a long time to get just one free rental day, and even then there's a time limit; free days usually must be used in the same calendar year it is earned.  In other words, I can use National for every single rental  every single year for the rest of my life and still won't get more than 3 consecutive days of free rentals.  So it's not really a loyalty plan as much as it is a ""what-have-you-done-for-us-lately"" plan.  

2) In a region of 2.3M people -there's only ONE National location anywhere close to me.  It's 40 miles away in one of the most inaccesible locaitons near the airport - not in the airport, but across the highway.  

3) Space is a premium. If someone drops me off they have 5 parking spots to choose from and most of the time at least 3 of them are occupied.  There's an additional lot that even smaller - 3 spots just down the road.  both lots are fenced off from the main rental lot.  

4) Finding another National in other cities that I travel in the Midwest is a feat.  I've never found  National Car Rental anywhere other than in or near large international airports.  That's inconvenient for some of my trips because sometimes I will drive to a nearby city, then take the train to another city. 

However, compared to my experience with the competition - National is still the best option for me.",2015-03-04 17:32:06

You walk in and it's a nicely appointed dining area with the open kitchen off to the side. They even have a drive-thru for take out.

You order and the food comes up on the counter. There is a selection of drinks in the refrigerator and some Dubuque coffee that is 3rd wave, dubious, bitter-sour coffee. Which all the hipster kids want to explain as bright and fruity with hints of hop much like a fine wine - bullshit. This is a $10 breakfast that you essentially serve yourself.

On to the food, I chose the Nest egg in concept something different & delicious. In execution, a doughy crust baked in the familiar St. Louis 'fricassee' burnt style. It is 2 eggs baked in a biscuit-lined soufflé tin, topped with crumbled bacon, mixed greens salad on top with pickled onions and lemon zest. What could have been brilliant was only a burnt under cooked mess. Served with a side of crispy potatoes. These are baby gold potatoes boiled and then 'crisped' on a griddle while doused is season salt. These were the best part of both meals. 

My better half ordered the biscuits and gravy breakfast with country ham & seasoned scrambled eggs. The ham was good but needed a few more minutes on the griddle to give it that nice crust. The biscuits & sausage gravy was a mixed bag. The biscuit was amazing while the sausage gravy was salty & full of sage. If you are not a fan of sage don't even think of getting this. Now, I'm not sure what spices were in the eggs. While I could  see the other spices; the only one you could taste was salt.

Had I known that I would have left a smaller tip.  Aside from ordering the only time me we saw or heard from anyone was when our food was dropped off.

I ordered the herb roasted beef which is supposed to come with a Laurel jus, bone marrow roasted mushrooms, and crispy leeks.  It was dry and overcooked IMO, it was slathered in BBQ sauce which is a far cry from a Laurel jus, there were no mushrooms of any kind to be found on the plate, and the crispy leeks were just burnt green onions (if you want to use green onions that's fine, there's plenty of synonyms for green onion if you wanna sound fancier, but leeks is definitely not one of them, it's an entirely different plant).

My fiancee ordered the fried chicken biscuit.  The entire plate was covered in honey and the biscuit was very dry.  Also some thought should have been put into how this was eaten.  Not exactly the kind of sandwich you can pick up and eat as the biscuit would have fallen apart and even were that not the case it would have been far too big to put in your mouth.  If it was designed to be eaten with a knife and fork that's fine, but provide the customer with something other than a butter knife otherwise it leaves people scratching their heads on howu to eat it.

We both had the macaroni and cheese which was so-so.  Not a lot of flavor built into, and the sauce wasn't terribly smooth.  It seemed as if the roux wasn't properly tempered before being added.  Also the menu said it had Gouda but neither of us could taste it.

The fish is good enough and I feel like three scoops is plenty filling. What really bothers me is that they can be really stingy with their toppings - though this seems to only be certain employees. If I'm paying $13 for my bowl, I would really appreciate a little more than a teaspoon-size serving of seaweed salad and edamame (not exaggerating). I understand they're probably trying to keep their costs own, but I would like this place so much more if they would stay consistent and slightly more generous with the toppings.",2018-03-10 02:06:21

nuVBwRpxeo8GAA4ZDRXiQQ,oVDHBcVeOyPZgVukQvsbwA,JgTSG4rIDf20Kgp6U_asng,4,0,0,0,"I  think the pizza is excellent. The Chicago Style Pizza is indeed Chicago Style, despite other reviews. It is a Chicago stuffed pizza style (with a top and bottom crust) like Giordano's in Chicago, but the sauce is less generous and is a spicier sauce than the tangy tomato sauce on a typical Chicago-style pizza. It is very good stuffed-pizza. The pizza isn't for everyone, but it is not accurate to say that it isn't a Chicago style pizza. 

I would recommend ordering your pizza in advance of your arrival due to the long cooking times, and also because you then have the option of just taking it home if there is nowhere to sit (it is a small dive bar). I think it sometimes has a soup-nazi feel to the service, as mentioned in some other reviews. They are slinging pitchers of beer and making a couple of particular kinds of pizza. You will not find anything beyond simple bar style service and you will not find Lou Malnati's pizza here, but it is an excellent diversion from the typical square-cut, thin-crust pizza in St. Louis.",2014-01-15 01:41:22

If I could give no stars I would!

My husband got a job in Austin last year which required us to move from Kingsville. The company offered to pay for our stuff to get moved and gave us a list of movers to get some quotes.

Because we only had a short time to find an apartment we found ourselves in a situation where we would have to stay in hotel for a week until our apartment was ready for us to move in. When the woman from United came to our Kingsville apartment to give us an on site estimate we explained the situation to her. She was told that we would be leaving for Austin on the Sunday morning and our apartment would not be ready until the Friday. She was told that we would put all our belongings in one room so there would be no confusion on what to pack and our roommates would let them in whenever they were going to pack our stuff. Simple. 

The next evening we get a phone call from United telling us that they have been selected to help us move and even though we still have 4 days before we make the big trip to Austin they will be coming to collect our things the next day. When we tell them this is not possible as we still need our bed to sleep on, clothes to wear etc etc they decide to call my husbands new employer and ask if they can put us up in a hotel for a few more days. This request was denied and they were told they would have to collect our stuff AFTER we have left. 

Fast forward a week. We had made arrangements with United to meet us at our new apartment at 12.30pm, during my husbands lunch break. We we told this would be no problem. At 3.30pm the day before we move into our new apartment my husband receives a phone call at work from United to tell him they will be at the apartment at 9am. He reminds them of the arrangement we had made and is rudely told that there was no such agreement and we were to be there at 9am or we will be charged extra. After being told this I decided I would call this woman back and remind her again that we were unable to get to the apartment until before 12.30pm. Now, this woman has absolutely no idea how to talk to a client, she was extremely rude and a liar. I called her and explained the situation we were in, I can't drive and at such short notice we were unable to make alternate arrangements to meet them so early. She told me that the driver had a full schedule and if we didn't meet them at 9am we would be charged extra. I told her that this was unacceptable as this had been organized a week prior and that she would need to see what she could do and she would need to call be back as my husband could not be disturbed at his new job. By 5.30pm I had not heard from this shrew of a woman so I decided to call back. The main office was closed but I was able to get through to the warehouse where the trucks get sent from. I managed to get such a lovely man on the phone. I explained the situation to him, he checked the drivers schedule and informed me that we were the only delivery he had all day so he could come whenever we like. Interesting. All while I am speaking to this lovely man, the shrew who didn't return my calls was on the phone to my husband telling him there is nothing she can do and we better be there at 9am or else. HA!

So everything was set and we would meet the driver at 12.30. I was even given the cell phone number of the driver in case we wanted to change our plans. This guy was so helpful and put my mind at ease that we would have no more problems. Silly me. The next day about half an hour before we are due to meet the driver my husband gets a phone call, again at work after they have specifically been told not to call him there, and the driver can't get to our apartment. It turns out he has used an 18 wheeler to move a bed, a desk, a computer and some clothes and now he can't fit in the apartment complex. He needs to go back to San Antonio to reload.

He eventually returns a few hours later with a smaller truck and is really a lovely guy. He unloads quickly and after a quick bottle of water is on his way. Over the next few days I unpack and notice some of our things are missing and our computer doesn't seem to turn on anymore. We fill out a report and a few weeks later basically get told we can't prove they took or stole anything so too bad. After all the drama we just gave up. It would have been better for us to get a U-Haul and do it ourselves. 

My husband was so embarrassed by all the trouble they caused by constantly calling his new employer complaining about us and trying to change arrangements. So much for trying to make a good first impression.

So again...

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.

And if you have any delivery problems, call the warehouse, they are the only helpful ones.",2008-03-04 19:04:36

Original Review-

Modern but inviting atmosphere with super friendly staff. Community seating for the most part, which I'm not into, so I was glad the little 2-seat table by the window was open. Also they have a drive thru - great option for hungry kids!

Their menu is straightforward and they use local, fresh ingredients. They have smoothies, cakes, and a kids menu as well. You go in, order, and they call your name when your food is ready. (Same dining concept as Fuzzy's).  We got to sample their gooey butter cake when we ordered, which was a nice surprise too.

I had the MO greens salad w/ goat cheese. Felafel was great, greens were fresh, the goat cheese really rounded it out - that's an extra but highly recommend adding it to this salad. House-made lemonade to drink - fantastic and refreshing as well. No complaints!

My husband had the traditional breakfast. He said the bacon was the best part; overall it was ok and could have used more gravy. 

Yolklore is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Don't bring your lunch date to dine-in, but the food is worth tasting, so drive thru and picnic instead.",2016-08-02 17:32:27
ZMosKT2Njz-RbLgNzDpOoA,kDeyHdQGVGdqYM11Q6lMTA,-bGw8ARHQucKWEHEkxpGFw,3,5,0,2,"The very best thing about Daily Bread is the food. they have a really extensive menu with so many things that sound good, it's hard to pick just one. Clearly the word is out because they get mobbed at lunchtime, and since they apparently make everything from scratch when it is ordered, the line is pretty long and you'll sit at your table for a good 10 minutes before they call out your name to come get your food. 

The seating area is really large, but the it feels cold to me. There are a few booths lining one side and a few bar height tables, and then just a sea of 4 seater tables in the middle of the room on a cold tile floor. They could really use something to make it feel more cozy and less like cafeteria seating.

Does it work? Yes if you drink enough.

Service is always fairly friendly with a bit of attitude. I can't imagine it any other way in a place like Black Thorn.

Food is OK but not amazing, though I do not recommend the pan pizza  - too much dough for my taste. The ""deep dish"" is not Chicago style. Chicago style goes, from bottom to top, crust, cheese, toppings, sauce. Note the lack of a crust on *top*. Black thorn puts crust on top. Not Chicago style. Some days it's better than other days - but regardless, this ain't Chicago style.

The beer is cold and tasty, and the selection is acceptable but far from amazing.

I finally was persuaded to visit about 2 years ago and I happened to be having a really bad day. We walked in, ordered at the bar, and were told pizza would be an hour. Ordered a pitcher of PBR to help kill the time and before I was finished with my first beer, my mood was improved immensely. The music selection is quirky. That particular day, every other song was a Killers song. The decor was non-existent, just marker graffiti covering everything. The beer was kind of flat. The pizza was good. So good I literally couldn't stop thinking about it until I went back days later. I'm writing this review because I hadn't been in about 6 months and finally revisited tonight now that renovations are done. I was worried when I walked in and everything looked shiny and new but the pizza was the same and the grungy charm is still there. They only have craft beer on tap now, though so we had to get our PBR in bottles. I'm reading the reviews for the first time and I see that maybe first timers need some pointers so if you're checking it out for the first time, it's not a place to go in and order carry out and wait for it. It takes a long time to make the pizza so if you're looking to just grab something and go, this isn't it. I highly recommend dining in and bringing some cards or a board game. It makes the wait enjoyable and half of the appeal of coming to Black Thorn is the experience. Seriously the best pizza and I've never had a bad time there.",2018-08-22 02:33:06

In my opinion, Blackthorn has the best pizza in St. Louis. I've eaten at almost every pizza joint in town, both city and county, dive and upscale, and this is the best. The sauce is what makes it. It's a spicier sauce, different from what you're used to on a pizza and it's outstanding. What I also like is that they don't skimp with the toppings. When you get bacon, you get huge chunks of bacon. Sausage...huge chunks of sausage. I think you get pretty darn good quality pizza for the price ($18 for a medium, for example).

Blackthorn also has thin, pan & Chicago-style deep dish crusts. My recommendation is to either go with the thin or the Chicago. The pan is almost too dough-y...so you might as well just eat the Chicago style deep dish at that point.

NEGATIVES:
The wait. To be clear, Blackthorn is a dive bar that happens to sell delicious pizza. They are not staffed for a quick pizza turnaround. And on the weekends, the wait can easily be 2 hours. Just know this and plan accordingly.

OTHER COMMENTS:
The bar itself, I think, is a great local neighborhood bar. It's not huge, has limited seating, but it has a charm unto itself. And the bartender has a nice mix of gruff and friendly that makes him endearing.",2012-12-02 00:47:11

First, ""Jack"" sent only TWO packers on day one to pack a 10 room house and large garage full of decorations, etc.  I complained, so four were sent on day 2.  Still not enough.  At the end of day 4, the truck was finally ""packed.""  
However, no one explained that all of our items were to be unloaded then reloaded again onto a different truck in Halifax!  WHY do that with SO much stuff?  Just Dumb.  
Our contract clearly stated all goods were to be unpacked and placed on the floor at our new home.  Nope!  The driver slept in his truck while two guys unloaded boxes unsupervised.  All goods had to be transported down our road by yet another (smaller) truck.  Lack of manpower once again!  Well, after two days of unloading the huge truck, the driver took off and left behind these two guys to do all of the unpacking & putting all furniture back together.  They needed help reconstructing the log bed and I ended up getting hit in the head with a log!   The driver had not even paid the two guys prior to departing.  Obviously, the job was not completed.  We complained, so a local company had to send two guys out on Father's Day!  The company owner, 
Joe, was clearly very upset bc of this.  Needless to say, I had to unpack 72 boxes.  And, ALL of the empty boxes were left on my front porch for five  weeks before Joe's guys came to pick them up.  I had called 4 times to get the boxes hauled off; which was in the contract as well by the way.  Then, they still had left 6 boxes on my front porch which I then hauled to our recycling center.  Now, the best part.  I notified Beth of the 11 broken items two weeks ago.  No help from her.  I notified jack.  No response.  Some items were not packed properly or at all.  Just thrown onto the trucks ...THREE different trucks!!!  Three times moved with no protection!  Dining room Furniture broken,  plates no longer available broken, pictures broken. a precious gift broken, large pottery flower pots broken.  All because people do not do their jobs.

Ambiance: The store is nice, clean, and quiet; however, there were only two of us there, probably cause it was snowing.
Service: Great prompt service, I didn't mind the wait as I knew they were cooked to order.

It does take between 45 minutes to an hour to get your pizza (even if you call right when they open). However, it tastes pretty freshly made and probably took a little time to put together with all the other people's orders in front of yours.

Fatty B - like a deliciously cheesy, meaty inside out pizza with twice the flavor. The red sauce (always on the side! Haha) adds a nice little spicy kick. 

The Duke - smoky chicken and bacon nicely offset with the sweetness of corn all wrapped up in a warm, hearty pocket of seasoned dough. 

Caesar salad - surprisingly enough, I have yet to find a better Caesar salad in this town. Like for reals. 

The calzones are all huge and I usually save half for another meal the following day. You're basically getting 2 meals for $10! 

Haven't dined in at this location, but I've gotten delivery from here plenty of times. Of note, it does take 45 min to 1 hour for delivery since calzones are made fresh and have to bake. They charge a small delivery fee of about $2 that's not a tip for the driver, but the food is so delicious that it's worth it.

We rented a car from Alamo/National for 6 days, which brought the bill to over $500.  The pick up was fine, the car was fine, however, the customer service at drop off was shameful.  

I made the mistake of leaving a scarf that belonged to my grandmother, my knitting project and a reusable water bottle in the backseat, essentially items of no value to anyone but me. I know they were left there because I left them in the car for the duration of the trip and I stayed with family who checked their house.  We dropped off our car in a rush to make a lunch.  As we were driving to the airport, I realized I had forgotten the items.  This was about 2 hours after dropping off the car.  With limited time, we went back.  The woman at the National desk took my info, said they would look for it and they call me if they found it and went back to whatever she was doing before. She could not have cared less.  A man, possibly the manager or a supervisor, saw that I was upset (teary at losing my grandma's scarf) and went out to look. Another employee, assured me that items rarely ""walk away"".   Unfortunately, I had to leave, otherwise I would miss my flight.

The next day, I called and an employee told me to call back the next day because the person who runs the lost and found was not in.  I called back and was put on hold after asking for the lost and found person.  I spoke to someone who didn't give her name but said only ""Ma'am we found the car in the dirty line after you left and checked for the items but they weren't there""  I said thank you and hung up, then asked my type A attorney cousin to please double check her immaculate guest house but no scarf or knitting.

Bottom line, someone at National/Alamo either stole my items or threw them away.  That kind of callousness to my belongings makes me certain I will look for another rental car company who will appreciate $500 worth of business better, train their front desk employees better and teach their back of house staff to not toss out or steal items. I have worked in hospitality, know it can be hard but it is common human decency to return lost and found things, rather than throw them out or steal.",2014-05-21 21:30:23

Pasta House was an okay choice amongst a sea of ho-hum airport offerings.

First, the staff is very good.  Their good mood and friendliness was a bright spot.  At the recommendation of two of them, we ordered the meatballs, and weren't disappointed.  They were tasty without an overpowering of seasonings or ordinary pasta sauce.   Even as an appetizer, though, two of them were too many because they were that big. 

Pasta House serves local beer and the Schlafly pale ale hit the spot.  In fact, it helped wash out the taste of the toasted ravioli, which had potential, but was overcooked and dry.  The chicken noodle soup, on the other hand, was good, proving the pasta house can do pasta right under the appropriate circumstances.

I would like to warn those of you thinking about coming for a lunch break treat, you might be here a while. Every time I've come in, there has been a pretty long line. BUT they keep it moving quickly and you should be up to the front.
This isn't meant for someone who has a 30 min lunch break. It's best for people who would like to enjoy their time and sit down with a friend to visit. Usually the tables are full, but they also have seating outside.

Before you make your decision, wander around he front of the line and make sure they don't have a small seasonal menu sitting out by the register that you could be missing. Happened to me both times I've been here and. I had to change my order on the spot because there were six or seven options I didn't know about! (I'm already terrible at decision making).

All in all, it's a great lunch spot for a nice date with your significant other, a friend, a roommate, or your momma. 


Note to the business:
The lines are getting a little bit excess and maybe you guys could consider expanding to another location/bigger location. Also, maybe you could find something such as NoWait, to help with the wait ones when you guys have full tables or are lined up out the door.

I went on a Sunday at about 3:30 p.m. and was happy to see a short line and was quickly greeted by a staff member. I ordered baked chicken (you get one meat) with the sides of cabbage and mac and cheese. It came with a cornbread muffin. I also ordered the caramel cake. My whole order cost $16. I was shocked that it was more expensive than Sweetie Pie's and  with less meat. Nevertheless, I enjoyed everything in my plate. The mac and cheese was delicious with just the right amount of creaminess. The cabbage was fairly good. The chicken was good but nothing to write home about. The cornbread muffin was a bit too sweet for me but others might enjoy it. The caramel cake was good as well. I will be back, but only when I have the funds. It is expensive!",2016-07-25 01:29:29

My final meal on this lazy Sunday was at Grace Meat + Three where I ordered the turkey leg with smoked tomato bisque and mashed potatoes! I had the turkey leg dressed with gravy and it was divine! I wish I would have ordered one to go to have for lunch this week. The mashed potatoes were very good and the smoked tomato bisque was not for me. It was broth based instead of cream based, so if that's what you're into, you may enjoy! 

I had dinner with the fam and my mom ordered the ribs and loved them. The bbq sauce she used for dipping apparently had a sweet aftertaste that she liked so much she got a cup to go. For sides she got the cornbread, which was good but a little dry like other reviews have mentioned and the mac and cheese which my 12 year old brother said he wished was hot and gooey. 

I took a star off because you order at the counter and with only one group in front of us we waited a good 10 minutes to place our order.

EBS came out after the initial tarping job done by another company left alot to be desired.  They re-tarped my roof quickly and the rainwater stopped leaking into the house.  Later, after the insurance company determined my roof needed to be replaced, I received an estimate from them for repair which was competitive.  I have to mention that they are a preferred provider with my insurance company, State Farm.  Mike Kinsella was my contact person and his response to any issues or questions that I had was great.

Because of the volume of damage done in the area, it was about three weeks before they began working on my roof, but the tarp continued to protect the interior so no damage was done.  It didn't hurt that we are going through a drought this year, so not much rain fell during this time.  They arrived full force and worked continuously on the roof all day (they must have eaten lunch in shifts because I never heard a lull in the work going on).  I have a small house, so they were finished in one day and I have to say it looks fantastic.

They picked up any debris that fell from the roof which was appreciated since I have two dogs.  They are BBB accredited, have a super service award from Angie's list in 2010 and 2011.

I highly recommend them to anyone need roofing repairs.",2012-08-13 20:10:57

And I found the wait pretty uncomfortable, because you are standing in a very small space by the door, but there's just no room! We went pretty early, and the crowd in the door just got worse and worse. I would have left if we had gotten there and seen that jam-up. However, our first time, we thought we would stick it out and try it. PS--no parking lot, so you have to take your chances on the street. 

We were seated at a table that had air conditioning bearing down on us like a north wind, so it was a pretty uncomfortable place to sit. I had a jacket with me, and wore it through dinner. My husband did not have a jacket, so we traded places, so he had slightly less wind and I took the REALLY cold seat.

OK, to the food. I got the Friday special of ""fish,"" which was fried cod. It was OK, but it turns out that I really don't like cod that much. I was not overly impressed. Husband had the burger, and you can't go wrong with that.

Overall, I found it OK, worth a return visit, but not my immediate new favorite. I was never comfortable, between the standing wait (good for them that people will stay, I guess) and the cold seating area (it wasn't a hot night, but even if it were, you don't want gale force winds hitting you). I wouldn't call it spacious inside--we were crammed in. 

However, lots of people appeared to be enjoying the bar. We are not drinkers, so that aspect was lost to us. You might want to give it a try, though, because it has a very happy neighforhood aura. Three-stars says ""A-OK"" and I just don't think it's better than that.",2011-05-14 12:41:47

A couple of things: 
1.) It's a dive.  Eating in is great, but don't expect UNO's or a nice family atmosphere.
2.) Even though it's a dive, it's great.  As everyone says the pizza is amazing.  Max 2 slices per person if ordering has been our experience.
3.) The staff is great once you realize that they are doing the best they can, and be sure to note that you're GOING TO WAIT on busy nights.  Just grab some more pitchers, enjoy the company you're with, and build up an appetite.  
4.) I recommend calling in for take out early, stopping in a few minutes before its done and pull up to the bar for a shot and a beer.

Holy Infant School has been blessed with the influence of the Sisters of Mercy, from County Meath in Ireland.
Beyond providing wonderful faith formation, the sisters also helped students and parents alike appreciate Irish Dancing.

The girls dance at school, off-site locations, and in the downtown St. Louis St. Patrick's Day Parade.

After the two-mile parade walk down Market Street, the kids are hungry.

Our daughter requested we visit Crown Candy.

This Saturday was a beautiful day; after a cold and snowy winter this was one of the first Saturdays with sun... and it was warm and no clouds... and that had the Crown Candy crowd wrapping outside the door, as is usually the case on a Saturday.

Our son was smart and recommended that we order out... and take it home... then our daughter realized we could just dine in the van and we did.

One ruben for our dancing daughter and our son and I each enjoyed a one pound of bacon BLT.
Two strawberry shakes
then
a few minutes later we were nice and filled up... and smiling

(And yes, I shared my BLT with my wonderful wife)

Inside, as we ordered, our daughter got some licorice for her brother and herself and we also picked up some chunk chocolate for Easter... the chocolate is hidden away for the rest of Lent.

The Crown Candy staff was friendly and helpful as always.

Great afternoon... and a nice food-induced nap on the drive home for me (wife driving).

Thank you, Crown Candy!",2019-04-25 05:13:34

Alright so yeah, you gotta wait a long ass time for your pie if you come in at 7-8pm on a Saturday night, but that's why you entertain yourself with beer and games until you are graced with its presence. Or, you take the waiting time into account and call in an hour or two ahead of when you need it, take it home, and pass out in a cheese-induced slumber. There is no table service, so when you need more of anything you have to put some work into it to get that 3rd pitcher of beer. Everyone I've ever met who works here has been polite and helpful, and I've never had an unpleasant experience.

Loaded with toppings, nice crust (albeit perhaps a little too much of it), cozy hole-in-the-wall ambiance that gets a little smoky, but that's a pub for you. Love the neighborhood feel of the place, and the bartender was very friendly. However, we arrived just a little after 6 and promptly ordered a pizza to go, and a couple beers to enjoy while we waited. Luckily they have some great dive bar games (shuffleboard? air hockey?!)... because we didn't get our pizza for about an hour. The end product was great, but by that time I was starving and tired and was wishing they had a selection of appetizers to snack on while we waited. Granted, this place is tiny, and we probably walked in shortly after several other orders had been placed. But the restaurant was relatively empty, and more than 30 minutes for a pizza seems a little egregious to me.

On the other hand, if you want a delicious, deep dish pizza stuffed with basic meats & veggies, (my fav. =  artichoke & mushrooms), where you never have to order extra cheese because you might fall into a dairy induced coma, from a true neighborhood corner dive bar, then you've hit the mother-load!

Be warned, there is no service outside the bar area - order drinks & your pizza at the bar and carry them to your table/booth yourself. You will be mocked if you saunter up to the bar and ask for the waitress.  The pizza will take a long time - likely an hour, and on the weekends, longer, especially if you've ordered Chicago style.

Tips for a fabulous time if you're planning on eating in:
Call ahead & place you order, just say it's for dine-in,
Upon arrival, order drinks, like a pitcher of Hefeweizen or a Jack n Coke (please save yourself & do not order a foo foo drink)
Find a seat (I like the booths around the corner), 
Play some shuffle board, darts or Pac Man while checking out the graffiti on the walls,
Wait to hear your name called in a somewhat, Charlie Brown-esque voice & be rewarded with Black Thorn's take on Chicago style pizza, in a warm, no fuss environment.

If you don't call ahead of time, be prepared to be three sheets to the wind by the time your pizza is ready! But hey, most of the patrons are locals and can walk home, so no harm no foul!",2012-09-10 07:13:36

All their menu items sounds so delish but I have yet to find something that will keep me coming back. It's pretty generic stuff - good, but not great.

That was the case with this Sports Authority and I must say they impressed me. 

We were on a mission to find ""manly"" yoga socks and were not having much luck. 
When we entered the store, I immediately was impressed with its size. I had never seen a SA this big. I guess size does matter, because we not only found what we needed, but received good customer service as well. 

Wanting a sport type sock, we walked over to the shoe department thinking they would be there.  In addition to the socks, we also were considering the Vibram Five Finger shoes. Unfortunately they did not carry the Five Finger shoes, but the sales associate was still very helpful. When we asked about the yoga socks, he told us they'd be in the yoga department. The what? Yoga has it's own department? That's impressive alone. 

What made him a stellar retail associate for me was the fact that he walked us over to the ""yoga"" department instead of doing the typical retail trick of pointing and saying ""over there"".  He assisted us in finding the socks and then excused himself to return to his own department.  We found a ""manly"" two shades of Grey sock that is going to  work just fine for the beginning yoga class. 

The one detail that kept them from getting a 4 star rating is their pricing. The yoga sock was the same brand we found earlier at Whole Foods selling for $9.99 and on sale for 20% off, was selling here for $11.99. Damn it, why did WF only have the girly pink socks in stock.

I was going 70+ miles in the fast lane, passing people. Your driver rode my ass for a good while, even after I tapped my brakes to let them know to back off. Then they flashed their lights at me multiple times. I was doing over 70 and passing people. There was NO reason for that reckless driving. If someone in front of me slowed or slammed on their brakes your flatbed tow truck would have crushed me and left me with severe injuries, or death. I got over and let them pass when it was safe for me to do so. However, this happened again as the both of us exited on to highway 40. I was in the fast lane, again going in excess of 70, and passed your driver. They then got behind me and rode my ass, and flashed their lights. They tried to pass me but there were cars in the center lane, unfortunately, leaving them no option but to follow me. This sort of driving of a large truck is reckless and potentially harmful.

JOANNE MACZA and her team have truly, literally, made me a better person. They not only helped me become pain free and put me back together, they also gave me the knowledge, skills and tools I need to help keep myself pain free, strengthen my body, and should I injure myself in the future, how to put myself back together. 
The human body will wreck itself trying to fix itself. After two kids and a slipped-disc back surgery, I had diastasis recti and a continual sore lower back.  I would dread going to bed every night because I knew in the morning when I woke up my lower back muscles would be in so much pain. Some mornings I was not even able to bend over to touch my toes, but on my own pants, or sit on the floor to tie my shoes. After being an athlete all through high school and college, I knew this was not how the body was supposed to be, and not how my core nor my back should behave. I knew something was wrong with my core. I did not accept the idea that ""this is how it is after two kids"". TAKE THE TIME TO PUT YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER. 
Joanne not only helped me work to heal my diastasis recti and teach me isometric core exercises to continually keep my core strong for life, but also worked with me to release scar tissue from my back, and retrain my body to use the proper muscles for movement instead of the ""work around"" my body had created when my abs didn't work. My back muscles were doing all the work for my abs. She then retrained me how to sit, stand, walk, get out of bed, pick up my children, and finally how to hold myself and stay strong during workouts so I don't repeat any of these injuries again. 
Joanne and her team have literally given me my life back, and also given my husband his wife back, and my boys their mother back. For that I will be forever thankful. 
During my visits to physical therapy, I have watched Joanne teach a ballet dancer how to dance better, a baseball pitcher how to throw a ball better, a weight lifter how to lift better, and then me, how to do daily life things better. I'm convinced there is nothing Joanne doesn't know. She listens to what injuries you have, and then backtracks through your whole body to find the reason for the pain, and not just cure what hurts. She is concerned with making your body the best machine it can be, and how it can work in the most proper form. 
I highly recommend you go visit Joanne for anything that bothers you. She is a fantastic human being and great at her job, and honestly wants to help make you better.",2018-02-18 22:27:56

As soon as they opened at 5pm, I was on the phone calling to place my carryout order.  At first, I kept receiving a busy signal and wasn't sure if I had the right number.  But try try again, my persistent paid off when my call was finally answered...I guess there were a lot of carryout orders being called in when I was trying to call mine in too.  I placed my order for a large deep dish ultimate veggie (hold the artichoke hearts).  

It would take about an hour.  I arrived 55 minutes later to find out, it'll be another 20 minutes of waiting.  Normally I wouldn't mind the wait, but I was missing the Super Bowl.  All I wanted was a good deep dish pizza, a beer and to sit with my two little pups curled next to me in the comfort of my own home watching the greatest game of the season.  

While I waited, I took the time to note not only how much of dive bar this place really was but how unclean it was too.  There was a good layer of dust behind the bar amongst the clutter of knick knacks, junk and bottles of booze.  A glimpse of the kitchen area wasn't any better, the floor and counters could all use a good wipe down.  There was only one table of 6 seated for dinner during the time I was there and a handful of carryout orders that came and went. 

I was so excited to get that pizza home.  I opened the box and was a little surprised, it didn't look very DEEP to me...a little over 1"" high.  For all that baking time, the crust wasn't much more than a thick crust by my hubby's standards.  There was a ton of cheese, at least 1/4"" thick.  A little more than a Wisconsin Cheesehead like me would care for.  The crust was very soft and cheesy all the way to the end.  But cheese aside, the flavors were good and the sauce had a little kick to it.

Glad I tried it, but not my favorite.  IMHO...too long of a wait, not the cleanest establishments, overly cheesy, crust lacked pizazz and they seem to lack pizza consistency...I wish I would have gotten that 3"" deep dish I read about.

They have a ""roots"" line that is a more traditional brewing style and a ""twisted"" line that is their spin on brewing styles. 
The beers are Cheap! 20Oz pours for $5!!

I had the Irish Flu, Kingsmen and Hey Joe. All of them fantastic. My wife who is not much of a beer drinker enjoyed the beers too. We only had appetizers for food and it was great. 
Will definitely revisit. All brews done on site and it's a very laid back atmosphere!

F0HT3WlDtWkshylMNJS5_w,C-ciSXshYaVG3vmD29rRdw,lPq6dXb6vJ6POp2-a00yZQ,5,3,0,3,"i recently lost my job and was (thankfully) able to find work out of state.  Although a ""lease-is-a-lease"" (legally), Saum/Hutcheson management did everything they could to rent my apartment as soon as possible and minimize my legal obligations to finish out the lease.  They did not have to do this, but they did.  

I also just have to address some of the negative reviews I have seen posted.
1: ""Things went ""missing"" during my move.""  Well, you're in the city.  The Big City...Saint Louis! You need to keep an eye on your stuff.  if you leave things sitting around, unobserved, while loading in and out of the building...guess what?  Sometimes bad people take rhem.  This is NOT the fault of the apartment management.

2: ""Plumbing problems...Crud, hair, urine, semen (??WTF??) backed up into my tub.""
 Okay....I won't even delve into how that person performed the detailed forensic analysis to determine the individual constituents of the ""crud"" that backed up into their tub.  
But, this can happen in apts, especially high rise buildings.
The Saum/Hutcheson are beautiful, historic buildings.  Old buildings have issues on occasion.  It happens.... but maintenance has always responded promptly to any issues, plumbing ir otherwise.
ALSO: Old buildings in the city use window unit air conditioners.  Just a fact of life...everywhere.  And if you let it run when its cold outside, you destroy the compressor.  My unit went bad, and it was replaced without question.  Why?  BECAUSE I DID NOT RUN IT WHEN IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE!!

Plumbing: My (two) plumbing issues (kitchen sink and bathtub) were handled immediately, professionally, and had rapid responses at very late calls in the early morning hours.  

Make no mistake....apartment life in a high rise building built in the early 20th century requires a certain amount of understanding on the tenants part.  But I have witnessed management replacing hundreds of feet of vertical piping....tearing out and patching plaster walls in multiple units, at what must have been considerable (necessary) expense...and FIXING the problem!  Just to resolve my kitchen sink backing up.  I was grateful and impressed.

So.. .if you want a plain, crackerbox, beige, boring apt with a dishwasher, garbage disposal,  a postage stamp ""patio"" and sliding glass door...look elsewhere.

But if you want to live in a building with history, character, a staff that truly cares and wants to help fix any issues....on SOUTH BROADWAY!!!  With window views of the Arch, close to everything cool in STL, in Tower Grove Park, spending breezy summer evenungs with your friend just looking out your window at the city, way up in the sky....then this is a place to consider.

Mama had the Patty Melt which had a generous amount of swirly rye bread.  Her only complaint was that she had a lot of bread left over, but the doggy box solved that.

We walked out the door with 2 meals and 2 drinks for under $25 before tax.

I love the food at Daily Bread - it's all made fresh, and the portions are generous. My favorites are the seasonal salads, and Autumn Crunch, as well as their clam chowder - yum!

The Daily Bread is very popular, and therefore gets crowded at lunch time. Your best bet is to go early, or do what I do and call your order in for carryout. Prices are a little higher than Bread Co., however, carryout portions are worth the price, versus the micro packaging Bread Co has adopted for their drive thru orders.

Out of shop my car worked for one day. Then stalled on me twice while driving. I brought it back and it was another $1200 maybe $900? To fix the problem. I would have just bought a new car if the repairs were more than $2000 initially. I did not have the financial capability to accommodate any price over $2000. I tried to make the $1600 work though because my car is very useful for my line of work. After pulling some strings I was able to cough up the money. 

Mind you, to repair the car any further it was at least $600-900 more because the coolant can was damaged. But I wish I knew this prior to driving it. Again, it didn't work after a full day of use. But all fluids were checked. I couldn't pay for this again nor could I go without a car for much longer. I ended up bringing the car to car max and trading it in. Again a car is very useful in my line of work so I needed it ASAP. I didn't have a car for about three days while it was in their shop and it really set me back. I called initially to ask for compensation considering how much money I had dropped on the repair. Mike had told me he could tow the car to the shop and try and fix the problem. All I would pay for was the part. The part USED, was apparently $600. I would not pay that money on a 2007 Toyota Prius. Nor would I have the capability to be without a car again. I declined. I asked for a $400 refund Mike said he would call back, never did. Two weeks pass and I drove there again asking to speak to the owner, Mike. He was at lunch. I came back again two hours later, still at lunch. His employee relayed the information and Mike called me back that night right after they closed. (I'm glad they're busy!) :-) Mike was short and demeaning, understandable. I look young and oblivious to the world. It's easy to act like I'm the person in the wrong. And apologized for taking so long to get back to me. He mentioned his lawyer would allow for a good faith agreement. Sure. They gave me the option to either get their auto repair service maintenance thing for a year OR $56 for the initial diagnosis. I'm not planning on living in STL for much longer so I opted for the $56. 

I understand the work put into my car but I expected some compensation. Not $56 worth of compensation, but it's okay! It's some money back. 

All in all, I would not recommend them to anyone. I always believed that a diagnosis meant FULL diagnosis. But Mike told me countless of times, ""I can't predict the future."" Because I guess you're supposed to be able to predict the future rather than addressing the problem before it surfaced in the future.

The dumplings here are okay. The extremely limited menu here doesn't scream sophistication as it would at other establishments in the same vein, but rather just constricted and similar choices. The three dumplings we had may as well have all been the same, as the flavors are not different enough to differentiate whether you're eating beef, pork, or seafood for that matter.

The food came out quickly and ordering was quick and simple. The prices are out of control expensive though, as another Yelper points out in these reviews the $8 and $12 price points for six small dumplings is kind of egregious. We split three bamboo steam baskets of dumplings including pork / seafood / beef, for a total of 18 dumplings. Sounds like a lot, but it isn't. They're very small, bite size and unfortunately the menu is so limited you don't really have an option to order any sides (they bring a very small cup of tofu-broth soup out before the food though), not that we could really afford to anyhow, it was $34 ($17 each) for this and we both left feeling hungry. For $34 one can probably do better in the quantity department at nearly any other establishment within 0.5 mile.

There are no drink fountains, which would not be a criticism except that you cannot just get a glass of water, you're forced to buy it if you care for a beverage. You can purchase Sam's Club brand bottled water for $1 among a few other soft drinks. Also in the drink cooler were what looked like jars of rice? As well as a couple of other items i could not identify, nor if they were to go w/ the meal or just side items to take and go. Your option for dining utensils are chop sticks, naturally, and styrofoam plates. This is terrible for the environment and for $34 i want to eat on ceramic. This isn't a taco-truck, this is a sit-down establishment and it just doesn't jive with the food or strike a balance regarding what this restaurant is seemingly trying to achieve. To use a credit card one must have a bill of no less than $25, this is a major business-first, customer-second inconvenience, on the other hand you'll have no problem hitting that dollar mark since the prices are so high, as i mentioned. 

There is no music playing, and it's an otherwise sterile, echo-filled hallway that bounces every conversation in the room directly towards your ears. It was difficult to converse without raising our voices, which is odd for such a small place.

I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, and honestly a few tweaks would make it a go-to lunch spot. It feels half-done, and again not putting the customer first at nearly all levels makes it difficult to want to come back.",2017-10-13 18:25:56

I stopped in, grabbed the pizza and headed back home to enjoy this monster in the comfort of my own home. I was truly impressed, the large pizza felt like it weighed 10lbs. Ok, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not much. I could not wait to get home and dig in. 

Fast forward about 20 minutes and we were tearing into this thing, but we didn't do a whole lot of damage to it. Everyone was stuffed after just one piece. It had peperoni, bacon, sausage and a few other meats I think, and was loaded with cheese. 

It tasted almost as good for breakfast the next day and was just as filling. This place is less than two miles from home and I can't believe it's taken us a year to visit.

We also ordered spring rolls as an appetizer.

A table that was sat after us had multiple apps brought out long before ours came out. The spring rolls came out as the same time as my fried rice. My husbands dinner was no where to be found. About 10 minutes later his dinner came out of the kitchen. It looked great, but it was emitting a bad smell. The taste was decent but the smell won. He could not finish his meal. The fried rice was great, the vegetables very fresh. 

We were very patient at our table. I've worked in the industry and am familiar with serving multiple tables and the stress that can occur.

We were pretty bummed, but we were determined not waste the night. We threw around a few ideas, and then I remembered that I had saw an axe throwing place down the street. I've heard of these opening up and starting to become popular, but honestly I wasn't sure really how fun it would be. We decided to give Top Notch a shot.

We walked in around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and were able to secure a spot for the both of us. Here are a few things that would be helpful for a first timers.
- Two options for sessions, $20 for 30 min and $35 for 90 min
- Walk-ins are welcome, but you can also make a reservation online
- You can bring your own food in, they do not have food
- You can bring your own drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic), they do have non-alcoholic drinks for sale
- There is a convenience store you can buy food and drinks at around the corner

With this being my cousin and my first time, we went with the 90 min session which I would highly recommend if it is your first time. It gave us a good chance to get used to the axes, play around with throwing cards and stars. Ben, the Axe Master, gave us a quick tutorial and safety guidelines. I appreciated that the explanations were short and sweet and allowed us to get to the throwing quickly!

My cousin and I each got our own lanes and quickly got the hang of it. I don't know what it is about axe throwing, but we were having an absolute blast just throwing the axes at the target. We didn't even need games, I love just hearing the sound of an axe hitting and sticking to the board. 

There are games though. The Axe Master will go through games about 30 mins into the session and then hand you throwing cards and stars in about another 30 mins. I appreciated the gradual introduction of new items. This allowed us to get comfortable without feeling overwhelmed.

90 mins of constant axe throwing is quite a bit. My arm was hurting by the end of it, maybe because I'm getting old. I still had an amazing time though. I'm glad we didn't make it to the poker tournament, because it led to Top Notch!

The Axe Master did a great job checking in with us and encouraging us throughout the whole session. I had a blast! I've already scheduled my next visit with 5 of my visiting college friends!",2019-07-16 12:14:08

Unfortunately we had to remind our waiter to bring the glass of tea, however we didn't receive it until after our lunch arrived. I also had to ask for clean utensils, both my fork and knife had dried food on it. Once brought to the waiters attention they addressed it quickly and were apologetic.

We ordered the chips and salsa. The chips are made in house and served hot. The salsa was not a juicy/liquid salsa, it was more of a think red thick salsa. Both were really good.

We had the Machete Pollo, it was kinda like a quesadilla but a little different. In the description it said it had fundido cheese, however you couldn't tell. Flavor wise, it had a really good flavor, and nice little kick to it. Wish there was a little more of the corn. The corn was amazing. Overall be both enjoyed the Machete Pollo.

We also had a Gringo Taco & Al Carbon taco. The gringo taco was very flavor full, the chipotle crema was very good on this.The al carbon was on point. Super delicious, had a great kick, the steak was cooked perfectly.

She was really friendly, welcoming, and outgoing. After placing your order, you are handed a table card to put on the table of your choosing. They're ""so St. Louis"" by featuring famous St. Louis neighborhood landmarks. Mine was Sacred Heart in Florissant.

I ordered the half slab of BBQ ribs with a side of mac-n-cheese and greens, with sweet tea. I thought that based on the name, the entrees came with three sides, but that must no longer be the case as I as informed that all entrees come with your choice of two sides.

My food arrived to my table really quick, and the person who brought my food to me was also very friendly. The food was really good! My ribs were meaty, had good flavor, and were really tender. The greens were also really good, however the mac-n-cheese isn't baked and wasn't the best ever, but also wasn't bad.

The dining room is very nice and spacious with both communal tables and private tables and booths.

Yes, I know Enterprise, National and Alamo are part of the same company (Parents, children, siblings, I don't know. Just something related), but there's a world of difference among them.

I'll say that the National agent at the counter in Lambert Airport was absolutely wonderful. Quick, affable, flattering (""Girl, are you a model?""), and a musician to boot. He did the ""It is not. It is NOT!"" thing when he saw on my driver's license that my birthday was the following day, and he enthusiastically wished me a happy one. He was fabulous in every way.

That's where the fun ended. Some differences:

* The Enterprise shuttle driver helped everyone with their bags, even my measly single backpack. The National driver just waited for people to board.
* The Enterprise shuttle driver offered bottles of water. National offered nothing.
* The Enterprise shuttle driver welcomed everyone, and no ""special classes"" were alluded to. The National Driver gave preferential treatment to the Emerald class, whatever that is, and he gave them more direction than us non-Emerald class people.
* Emerald people were dropped off in a special lot with special assistants milling about. Because I was non-Emerald, I was dropped off in a lot and told find the car size that I ordered in a certain section.

More headaches:
* Naturally, I couldn't find my car's section and I was confused if I needed to check in at all before just taking a car. I walked inside, was told I didn't need to check in, and someone pointed (from wayyyyy behind the counter) in the general direction of the cars I could take. Yes, ""take."" Keys were in the ignition.
* I asked about a walkthrough, and the counter person told me to note any imperfections and tell the lady at the booth on the way out. I had nothing to note imperfections on. Luckily, I chose a car with nothing wrong.
* The signage for exiting the lot was bad, and I didn't see arrows on the ground.
* The woman in the booth was extremely fast and didn't ask if anything appeared to be wrong with the car.
* When I returned the car, the inspection was super-fast and, in my opinion, not very thourough.
* I told an attendant that instead of taking the shuttle back to the airport/Metrolink, I'd wait for a friend (Hi, Christine F.!) to pick me up. The National attendants told me to tell her to come in through the main entrance on the main road, not the car return entrance. I told her that, but she called me in a confused panic because there really was no entrance. After 10 minutes, we finally realized that the attendants really meant that Christine could come into a pea-sized parking lot with four spaces for visitors' cars. I had to walk across a long lot to her; she couldn't drive over and get me. I'd hate to think about someone less able-bodied trying to make their way to a friend's car.

I got a great deal on Priceline, but I think I'll just suck it up and pay the extra $10/day to use Enterprise from now on, since they actually give a crap about their customers. Seriously. Lesson learned.",2011-11-16 23:50:24

Not surprisingly, there was a huge line when I got there, so I knew it was going to be pretty amazing.

Bandmates and I decided we didn't want to wait, so we actually just walked in, and discovered there was an entirely separate area for carry out orders! The one downfall of Crown Candy is the limited seating, so we were perfectly content to get our orders without having to wait in line, and eat back at home. Keep that in mind if you do not want to wait 40+ mins to dine in.

I wanted the full experience, so I went with their famous BLT, and a chocolate milkshake. Let me just say this: the BLT lives up to its reputation (think it was voted one of the best in the country?) 
You will get so much bacon stuffed between two pieces of bread that you just might get the meat sweats trying to finish it. The milkshake is really rich as well. Try theirs, and then try one from any other restaurant, and you'll never see milkshakes the same way again. Definitely a perfect ten, in my book.

I got the nest egg. The description makes it look like it's to die for. It was much less than this. I wanted the ratio of filling to bread to be much heavier on the filling side and it was probably 80/20 with the bread taking over completely. I took only a few bites before just having bread left. It said three eggs and I find that very hard to believe. I was also extremely bummed about the potatoes. They took a small potato, seasoned it and smashed it on the grill for a few minutes. They weren't crispy and the inside was totally bland. Not to mention they only give you two.

Main focus of the restaurant is breakfast and lunch items. Based off the previous reviews, the Nest Egg and Pancake Rollup seemed to be the most popular.

The Nest Egg is a hollowed out biscuit shell with two eggs, bacon, cheese, greens, and pickled onions. It was a tough decision on how to attack it, but the knife and fork route seemed safest. As soon as the knife sliced through the egg white, the yolk exploded on to the tray and it turned into a giant mess. So time to grab the biscuit pieces and scoop as much fillings as possible. Not exactly what I envisioned but it turned out okay. The biscuit seemed a little dry but it helped to absorb the egg yolk. 3.5/5

The Pancake Rollup consisted of two scrambled eggs, turkey chorizo, cheddar cheese, pickled jalapeños, fire roasted salsa, and a lime crema. The cheese, chorizo, and jalapeños were the perfect blend of spice with the lime crema to cool it down. My only comment would be more filling and less crepe. Other than that, it was amazing. 4.5/5

Everyone in the restaurant was very cheerful even though it was in the middle of a snow storm.

I checked this place out after seeing Steph's glowing review on it. I needed to chill out the night before taking my nursing licensure boards.

I read all the thorough descriptions on the website and also decided on the La Stone ThermoTherapy. I was able to make my appointment online, which was very convenient, and didn't have any trouble getting a slot for that night.

The place in Crestwood Mall is very relaxing right as you go in. I filled out their paperwork and then had about a five minute wait as I perused their coffeetable books.

Jackie was also my massage therapist. She sat down with me and asked my reasons for coming in today (apparently her top three clients are nurses, doctors, and police officers...not surprising!) and explained everything from the beginning of what to expect. She was very patient and kind.

The massage engaged all my senses - the room was dimmed with candlelight (but I did have an eyemask on during the actual massage), I had headphones on playing relaxing music, she used aromatherapy...the table I was on vibrated with the music, which I knew about going in and I was afraid it would be distracting, but it wasn't. And Jackie worked her magic with hot stones and her hands literally from head to toe.

Like Steph said, it was a true 60 minutes. Also, you can do the massage in your underwear or completely naked, it's up to you. She doesn't try to sway you one way or the other, but I went totally nude because I have no shame. =] And I think I got the most out of it that way. But if you are shy, she is okay with that.

The massage was fantastic. Sublime. I did not want to get off that table. I felt like jello afterwards.

I called my mom on the way home and told her I felt high. I guess that's a good massage! And I passed my boards the next day! Success! :)",2010-09-27 20:54:57

It was so thick that it was initially impossible to suck it up the straw until it melted a bit more.

There wasn't any single thing I could point to and say, ""this is bad"".  It was more like death by a thousand cuts.  
First of all, I was annoyed that the name is a lie.  It isn't meat + 3, it's meat + 2.  Sure you can get an extra side, but it isn't standard like the name suggests.  Is this a quibble?  Yes it is, but it set the mood for the rest of my experience.  
I had the biscuits appetizer, chicken, mac and cheese, home fried potatoes, and the apple cobbler.  The biscuits were tough, like the dough had been over worked, and the topping potions on the small side for the amount biscuits served.  The flavors for the jam and pimento cheese were good, but the whipped lard tasted like spoiled mayo with a bad mouth feel.  It's subjective, I know, other people might love it, but me - not so much.  The chicken was as good as I expected, crisp, moist and well seasoned.  I can't tell a difference in what he served at Southern.  The mac and cheese had the same issues as the dish had at Southern, too dry and not enough cheese flavor.  The bread crumb topping just made things worse.  The home fries were on the verge of being over done, but were otherwise tasty.  The apple cobbler was over sweet and not very cobbler-like (it came across more like a Dutch Apple pie, which if the sweetness had been balanced wouldn't be a bad thing).  Overall the meal was between okay and good, but for the prices charged I expected a whole lot more.
From a presentation standpoint, the whole experience is a fail.  Outside of a BBQ place, I'm pretty much done with being served on cafeteria trays with paper containers.  It cheapens the whole experience.  
The dining room is nice, but they need to do something to baffle the sound in the room.  The echo and noise level was so bad I had trouble hearing the servers when they brought my meal.     
Overall I can't muster a lot of excitement about going back.  It was good, but I expected a lot more.  While that's partially my fault, I can't help but feel disappointed.",2017-10-23 16:08:03

Our favorites include House of India, Flavor of India, Saffron, Bombay, and Anis Hyderabad.  We were excited to try something new tonight.  We order chicken 65, samosa chaat, and malai tikka.  The malai chicken was raw and we couldn't chew it.  There was no way around it; it was completely inedible.  We love chicken from the tandoor and there was no way this was cooked in a tandoor let alone cooked properly.  Something was definitely off.  We called the owner and he apologized and offered a replacement dish- chicken tikka masala.  This chicken was cooked but full of gristle.  Upon cutting into it, the inside looked spongey and gray.  We truly couldn't believe it.  Our rice was hard and dry and most likely leftover from their lunch buffet.  The only saving grace was the samosa chaat which was delicious and a hard dish to find at our regular spots.  However, after biting into that so called chicken, we can't imagine ever coming back.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  It has a cool bar scene.

I have two complaints; the first is they charge for chips and salsa.  No respectable Mexican restaurant would break international Federale law by calling themselves a Mexican restaurant and then charging for this basic food item.

I had the taco salad with a side of rice and beans.  The food was all very good. The portion size was perfect, not too small or large.  The quality was very fresh.  My second complaint is they gave me very little dressing, when I asked for more I was not told I would be charged .75 cents.

Both the chips and charge for the dressing was not a big deal, but if the restaurant would stop the nickle and dime game they would have got 5 stars from me and probably more customers. 

Overall a really good restaurant, I would eat here again next time I'm in the area.",2018-10-31 16:25:27
