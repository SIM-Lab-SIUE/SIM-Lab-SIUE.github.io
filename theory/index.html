					<h3 class="column__title">Agenda Setting Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Agenda Setting Theory posits that the media plays a powerful role
							in shaping what issues are considered important in the public sphere. While the media
							may not tell people what to think, it tells them what to think about by emphasizing
							certain issues and omitting others. This theory is crucial in understanding the power
							of media in focusing public attention on specific topics, whether in politics, social
							issues, or economic concerns. In media studies, it helps to explore how media
							coverage can influence public opinion and the political process</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Cognitive Dissonance </p>
						<p class="column__text">Cognitive Dissonance Theory explains the psychological discomfort
							individuals feel when they hold contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. In
							communication, this theory is essential in understanding how people strive for
							consistency in their thoughts and how they use media to reduce dissonance. For
							example, a person might selectively expose themselves to media that aligns with their
							pre-existing beliefs to avoid cognitive discomfort</p>
						<p class="column__scholar">Key Scholar(s): Festinger (1957)</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Cultivation Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Cultivation Theory suggests that prolonged exposure to television,
							particularly violent content, shapes viewers' perceptions of reality. The more
							individuals watch TV, the more likely they are to perceive the world as violent or
							dangerous, a phenomenon known as the "Mean World Syndrome." In media studies, this
							theory highlights the long-term impact of media consumption on societal beliefs and
							values</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) </p>
						<p class="column__text">The Elaboration Likelihood Model explains how individuals are
							persuaded through two different routes: the central route, which involves careful
							consideration of the message's arguments, and the peripheral route, which relies on
							superficial cues such as a speaker's attractiveness or credibility. ELM is essential
							in understanding how communication affects attitudes and behaviors, particularly in
							media and advertising</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Framing Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Framing Theory focuses on how media structures news and
							information by highlighting certain aspects of an issue while downplaying others. The
							way media frames stories influences how the public interprets those stories. In
							communication studies, this theory examines how different framing techniques shape
							public perception and policy discussions</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Gatekeeping Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Gatekeeping Theory explores how information is filtered through
							various channels, such as journalists, editors, and content moderators, before
							reaching the public. Gatekeepers decide which news stories to report and how they are
							presented, influencing what information people consume. In media studies, this theory
							underscores the role of media professionals in shaping news content and highlights
							issues related to media bias and control</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Hyperpersonal Model </p>
						<p class="column__text">The Hyperpersonal Model describes how computer-mediated
							communication (CMC), such as email or social media, can sometimes be more intimate
							and personal than face-to-face interactions. It posits that online users can optimize
							self-presentation, leading to more controlled and idealized interactions. This model
							is important in understanding the dynamics of online relationships and how digital
							media influences interpersonal communication</p>
						<p class="column__scholar">Key Scholar(s): Walther (1996)</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Knowledge Gap Hypothesis </p>
						<p class="column__text">The Knowledge Gap Hypothesis suggests that the more information
							that is disseminated via mass media, the greater the divide in knowledge between
							those of higher and lower socioeconomic statuses. People with more education and
							access to information tend to benefit more from media, while less-educated groups
							fall behind. This theory is critical in media studies for understanding the
							inequalities in information access and how media consumption can exacerbate social
							disparities</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Online Disinhibition Effect </p>
						<p class="column__text">The Online Disinhibition Effect explains the phenomenon where
							individuals behave more freely and openly in online spaces, sometimes exhibiting
							behaviors they would not in face-to-face settings. This can manifest in both positive
							(e.g., sharing personal information) and negative (e.g., trolling or cyberbullying)
							behaviors. Understanding this effect is key in analyzing online communication
							dynamics and the social consequences of anonymity and disinhibition in digital
							environments</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Parasocial Interaction </p>
						<p class="column__text">Parasocial Interaction refers to the one-sided relationships that
							audiences develop with media personalities, such as TV hosts or social media
							influencers. Though there is no real reciprocity, viewers may feel as though they are
							part of an ongoing relationship with the media figure. In media studies, this theory
							is relevant for understanding how individuals connect with media figures and the
							psychological impact of such connections</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Social Learning Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Social Learning Theory posits that individuals learn behaviors by
							observing others, particularly those depicted in the media. If the behaviors are seen
							to be rewarded, individuals are more likely to imitate them. This theory is
							significant in media studies for understanding the impact of media portrayals on
							audience behavior, particularly in contexts such as advertising, entertainment, and
							social norms</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Social Constructionism </p>
						<p class="column__text">Social Constructionism argues that reality is constructed through
							human interaction and language, emphasizing that knowledge is not objective but is
							shaped by social processes. In communication studies, this theory is used to explore
							how media and communication influence the way we perceive the world, including
							concepts of race, gender, and class</p>
						<p class="column__scholar">Key Scholar(s): Berger & Luckmann (1966)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Social Exchange Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Social Exchange Theory explains human interactions as a process of
							weighing the costs and benefits of relationships. People engage in relationships or
							social interactions when the perceived benefits outweigh the costs. In media studies,
							this theory helps explain how individuals engage with media or social platforms to
							maximize their satisfaction, be it through entertainment, information, or social
							connections</p>
						<p class="column__scholar">Key Scholar(s): Blau (1964)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Social Identity Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Social Identity Theory posits that individuals derive a sense of
							identity from their membership in social groups, leading to in-group favoritism and
							out-group discrimination. This theory is essential for understanding how media shapes
							and reflects group identities, such as those based on nationality, race, or gender,
							and how these identities influence behavior and attitudes toward others</p>

			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Social Information Processing Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Social Information Processing Theory focuses on how people form
							relationships through computer-mediated communication (CMC) over time. It suggests
							that while online communication lacks non-verbal cues, users can develop meaningful
							relationships by compensating with language and timing strategies. This theory is
							crucial in understanding digital communication's potential to foster interpersonal
							connections despite its limitations</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tabscontent__item">
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="column__title">Uses and Gratifications Theory </p>
						<p class="column__text">Uses and Gratifications Theory explores how individuals actively
							choose media based on their needs and desires, such as entertainment, information, or
							social interaction. Instead of being passive consumers, individuals engage with media
							to fulfill specific goals. This theory is key in media studies to understand media
							consumption patterns and why different people use media in different ways</p>
