							<strong class="oh__inner">Theory Overview</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Agenda Setting Theory posits that the media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception by highlighting certain issues over others. By determining what topics are covered and how prominently they are featured, the media influences what the public considers important. This process does not tell people what to think, but rather what to think about, thereby setting the public agenda.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Seminal work by McCombs and Shaw (1972) demonstrated this effect during the 1968 U.S. presidential election, where the issues emphasized in the media closely aligned with voters' perceptions of the most important election topics. This theory underscores the power of media in prioritizing societal issues and shaping public discourse.</span>

						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Cognitive Dissonance Theory explores the psychological discomfort individuals experience when holding conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. This discomfort often motivates people to reduce the inconsistency by changing their beliefs, acquiring new information, or minimizing the importance of the conflict. The theory highlights the human tendency to seek harmony in their cognitive processes.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Leon Festinger's seminal work in 1957 laid the foundation for this theory, illustrating its application in various contexts, such as decision-making, attitude change, and social behavior. For instance, a smoker who knows the health risks of smoking might rationalize their habit by downplaying the dangers or emphasizing the stress-relief benefits.</span>

						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Cultivation Theory examines the long-term effects of television on viewers' perceptions of reality. It suggests that heavy television viewers are more likely to perceive the world in ways that align with the repetitive and consistent messages presented on TV. This "mean world syndrome" is a common outcome, where viewers believe the world is more dangerous than it actually is due to the prevalence of violent content.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Developed by George Gerbner and Larry Gross in the 1970s, the theory emphasizes the subtle yet profound influence of media on societal norms and values. Their research highlighted how television serves as a cultural storyteller, shaping collective beliefs and attitudes over time.</span>

							<strong class="oh__inner">Theory Overview</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) explains how individuals process persuasive messages through two distinct routes: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route involves careful and thoughtful consideration of the message content, while the peripheral route relies on superficial cues, such as the attractiveness of the speaker or the number of arguments presented.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Developed by Petty and Cacioppo in 1986, ELM provides insights into the factors that influence attitude change and the durability of those changes. Messages processed through the central route tend to result in more enduring and resistant attitudes compared to those processed peripherally.</span>

						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Framing Theory explores how the presentation of information influences audience interpretation. By emphasizing certain aspects of a story while omitting others, media frames shape the way people perceive and understand issues. This selective emphasis can significantly impact public opinion and policy decisions.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Robert Entman's 1993 work on framing clarified its role in communication, highlighting how frames define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. The theory underscores the power of media in constructing social reality.</span>

						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Gatekeeping Theory examines the process by which information is filtered and selected for dissemination to the public. Gatekeepers, such as journalists, editors, and media organizations, play a pivotal role in deciding what information reaches audiences. This selective process influences public discourse and societal priorities.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">David White's 1950 study introduced the concept of the "gatekeeper" in journalism, analyzing how a wire editor decided which news stories to publish. The theory has since expanded to include digital platforms, where algorithms and user-generated content also act as gatekeepers.</span>

						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">The Hyperpersonal Model explains how online communication can sometimes exceed face-to-face interactions in intimacy and intensity. Factors such as selective self-presentation, asynchronous communication, and idealized perceptions contribute to this phenomenon, enabling individuals to form deep connections in digital environments.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Joseph Walther's 1996 research highlighted the unique dynamics of computer-mediated communication, emphasizing its potential to foster meaningful relationships despite the absence of physical cues. The model remains relevant in understanding modern online interactions, including social media and dating platforms.</span>

						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">The Knowledge Gap Hypothesis suggests that information is not equally distributed across social groups, leading to disparities in knowledge acquisition. Individuals with higher socioeconomic status tend to gain information more quickly than those with lower status, widening the knowledge gap over time.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien's 1970 study provided empirical evidence for this hypothesis, examining how education and media exposure influence knowledge distribution. The hypothesis underscores the need for equitable access to information to bridge societal divides.</span>

						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">The Online Disinhibition Effect describes the tendency for individuals to behave differently in online environments compared to face-to-face interactions. Factors such as anonymity, invisibility, and lack of immediate consequences contribute to this phenomenon, leading to both positive and negative behaviors.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">John Suler's 2004 work on this effect highlighted its dual nature, where it can foster open self-expression and creativity but also lead to toxic and harmful behaviors. Understanding this effect is crucial in addressing challenges in digital communication.</span>

							<span class="oh__inner">Parasocial Interaction Theory explores the one-sided relationships that audiences form with media personalities, such as celebrities, influencers, or fictional characters. These relationships feel real to the audience, despite the lack of mutual interaction.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Horton and Wohl introduced this concept in 1956, emphasizing its role in media consumption and audience engagement. The theory remains relevant in the age of social media, where parasocial relationships are increasingly common.</span>

The theory highlights the importance of reinforcement and punishment in shaping behavior.</span>
						</p>
						<p class="oh">
							<span class="oh__inner">Albert Bandura's 1961 Bobo doll experiment demonstrated how children imitate aggressive behavior observed in adults.

						<p class="oh">
