# AURA Lab

**Avatars, Users, Relationships, and Affect Lab — Southern Illinois University Edwardsville**

*Where digital presence becomes research.*

AURA Lab is a computational communication research group at SIUE that studies how people form relationships, perform identity, and experience affect across virtual environments, streaming platforms, and digital media. Directed by [Dr. Alex P. Leith](https://apleith.com), Associate Professor (Tenured) in the [Department of Mass Communications at SIUE](https://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/mass-communications/). The lab produces peer-reviewed scholarship, open educational resources, and open-source tools.

> **Rebrand note:** AURA Lab is the May 2026 rebrand of the former *SIM Lab* (Social & Interactive Media Lab). The GitHub organization was renamed `SIM-Lab-SIUE` → `AURA-Lab-SIUE`; project repos retain their existing names and GitHub auto-redirects old URLs.

> **Note on scope:** This organization covers academic and instructional work at SIUE. Industry consulting, applied data tools, and contract software live under [SIM DAD LLC](https://github.com/SIM-DAD) separately.

**Live site:** [aura-lab-siue.github.io](https://aura-lab-siue.github.io) *(Coming Soon page live; full site in development through 2026. A future move to `aura-lab.siue.edu` is planned.)*

## Projects

### [Vibes to Variables](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/vibes-to-variables)
An open educational resource guiding undergraduate Communication and Media Studies students through a complete research project — from hypothesis to reproducible study — using a real dataset of 1,792 songs. Built with Quarto.

### [v2v](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/v2v)
Companion R package for the *From Vibes to Variables* OER textbook (SIUE MC-451 + MC-501). Ships the Twitch dataset and pedagogical helpers introduced chapter by chapter.

### [coursepackR](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/coursepackR)
Shared coursework material for MC-451 and MC-501 — assignment scaffolds and reproducible analysis templates for the research-methods sequence.

### [MethodoSync](methodosync/)
Browser-based qualitative research tool for video annotation and codebook generation. Built with Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. No server or account required.

### [Open Coding Studio](open-coding.html)
Self-contained, single-file Grounded Theory coding environment. Paste data, apply open codes, collapse to axial/selective codes, and export structured codebooks — no installation or backend.

### [MC Careers Dashboard](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/mc-careers-dashboard)
Interactive SvelteKit dashboard mapping Mass Communications career paths, salary data, and skill requirements for student career planning.

### [Equipment Checkout](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/equipment-checkout)
Web application for managing and reserving production equipment for SIUE Mass Communications students. Built with TypeScript.

### [Comm Theories Explorer](theories/)
Interactive GSAP-animated guide to common mass communication theories, designed to help students identify an appropriate theory for their research project.

### [Open Methods Hub](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/open-methods-hub)
MC Research Methods course website for MC-451 at SIUE — the umbrella for the research-methods teaching ecosystem. Companion Obsidian vault at [mc451-liaison-program](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/mc451-liaison-program).

### [Open WebUI Launcher](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/open-webui-launcher)
One-click launcher for Open WebUI with DeepSeek-R1 via Docker — a local-AI on-ramp for students and lab researchers.

### [Hate Raids](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/hate-raids)
R-based data and analysis behind the peer-reviewed Hate Raids paper — examining coordinated harassment events on Twitch.

### [Banned Word Checker](https://github.com/AURA-Lab-SIUE/banned-word-checker)
Python tool for testing Word documents or PDF submissions against a list of prohibited terms — built for instructional and content-moderation use cases.

## Identity System

The AURA Lab visual identity is maintained by the lab director. Headline summary:
- **Palette:** Deep Graphite (`#0E0E12`) primary background, Warm Chalk (`#F4F0EB`) light alternate, Aura Violet (`#7C3AED`) primary accent, Amber Signal (`#F59E0B`) secondary accent.
- **Typography:** [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) for display, [Instrument Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans) for UI and body, [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) for code and metadata.
- **Mark:** AURA wordmark in heavy Fraunces, paired with a subtle radial element (the "aura ring") that reads as halo, aperture, and avatar selection indicator at once.

## Development

### Main site

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321
npm run build    # output to ./dist (also copies legacy pages via postbuild)
npm run check    # type-check + Astro diagnostics
npm run preview  # serve ./dist locally
```

### Content workflow

- **Publications:** edit `src/content/publications/pubs.yaml`. Only public-facing entries (DOI, preprint, or in-press) pass schema validation.
- **News:** add a Markdown file under `src/content/news/` with `date`, `title`, optional `tags`.
- **Projects:** add a YAML file under `src/content/projects/` with `area`, `status`, `blurb`.
- **Tools:** edit `src/content/tools/tools.yaml` (research tools) or `src/content/tools/teaching.yaml` (teaching resources).
- **Director bio + links:** `src/content/people/director.yaml`.
- **Research-area copy:** Markdown under `src/content/research-areas/`.

### Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the Astro site and deploys to GitHub Pages. **One-time setup:** GitHub → Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions".

A future migration to `aura-lab.siue.edu` will add a `public/CNAME` once SIUE IT provisions the subdomain.

### MethodoSync (separate sub-app)

```bash
cd methodosync
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # build to methodosync/ root (commit index.html + assets/)
```

> **Note:** Vite root is `src/` to prevent the source `index.html` from being overwritten on build. The built `index.html` and `assets/` directory are committed alongside source.
