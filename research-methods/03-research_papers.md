# Introduction to Research Papers

## Structuring a Research Paper

Writing a research report requires careful organization to effectively communicate the purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions of a study. Each section of a research paper serves a distinct function, guiding the reader through the research process in a logical and structured manner. Understanding the role of each section and how to write them effectively ensures that the paper is clear, coherent, and impactful.

### Title {.unnumbered}

The title of a research paper is the first point of engagement for the reader. It should be **clear, concise, and informative**, giving a snapshot of the study's focus. A strong title includes key variables or the primary subject of study without being overly lengthy—typically no more than **12 words**. It should be formatted correctly, **bold, centered, and double-spaced** on the title page. Capitalization rules apply: **only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized**, even if a semicolon is used in the title. A well-crafted title ensures the reader understands what to expect, improving discoverability in academic databases.

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

The **abstract** is a concise summary of the research paper, typically **150 to 250 words** long, providing an overview of the study. It is written in **past tense** and should not contain citations. The abstract must succinctly cover the **research purpose, methods, key findings, and conclusions**. Since the abstract is often the first—and sometimes only—part of the paper that many readers engage with, clarity and brevity are essential. A well-written abstract enables readers to quickly assess the relevance of the study to their interests and research.
