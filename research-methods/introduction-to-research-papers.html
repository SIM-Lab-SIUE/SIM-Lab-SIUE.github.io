<p>Writing a research report requires careful organization to effectively communicate the purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions of a study. Each section of a research paper serves a distinct function, guiding the reader through the research process in a logical and structured manner. Understanding the role of each section and how to write them effectively ensures that the paper is clear, coherent, and impactful.</p>
<div id="title" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Title<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#title"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The title of a research paper is the first point of engagement for the reader. It should be <strong>clear, concise, and informative</strong>, giving a snapshot of the study’s focus. A strong title includes key variables or the primary subject of study without being overly lengthy—typically no more than <strong>12 words</strong>. It should be formatted correctly, <strong>bold, centered, and double-spaced</strong> on the title page. Capitalization rules apply: <strong>only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized</strong>, even if a semicolon is used in the title. A well-crafted title ensures the reader understands what to expect, improving discoverability in academic databases.</p>
</div>
<div id="abstract" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Abstract<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#abstract"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The <strong>abstract</strong> is a concise summary of the research paper, typically <strong>150 to 250 words</strong> long, providing an overview of the study. It is written in <strong>past tense</strong> and should not contain citations. The abstract must succinctly cover the <strong>research purpose, methods, key findings, and conclusions</strong>. Since the abstract is often the first—and sometimes only—part of the paper that many readers engage with, clarity and brevity are essential. A well-written abstract enables readers to quickly assess the relevance of the study to their interests and research.</p>

<p>Keywords are the foundation of any search. Start by identifying the main concepts of your research topic. For example, if you’re researching the effects of social media on mental health, your main keywords might be “social media,” “mental health,” and “impact.” Input these keywords into your chosen search engine to begin your search.</p>
<p><strong>2. Utilize Advanced Search Features</strong></p>
<p>Most specialized search engines offer advanced search options that allow you to refine your search. You can often specify criteria such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Publication Date:</strong> Limit your results to recent publications to ensure the information is up-to-date.</li>
<li>
<strong>Language:</strong> If you’re only interested in articles written in a specific language, you can filter results accordingly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Document Type:</strong> Narrow down your search to only include journal articles, reviews, conference papers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, in Google Scholar, you can access these options by clicking on “Advanced Search,” which allows you to combine keywords with Boolean operators, search within specific journals, or exclude certain terms from your results.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Quotation Marks for Exact Phrases</strong></p>
<p>When searching for specific phrases, using quotation marks can help ensure that the search engine looks for the words together in the exact order you’ve specified. For example, searching for “impact of social media on mental health” will return results where this phrase appears as is, rather than finding articles where these words appear separately.</p>
<p><strong>4. Apply Boolean Operators</strong></p>
<p>Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) are powerful tools for refining your search:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>AND:</strong> Use AND to narrow your search. For example, “social media AND mental health” will return articles that contain both terms.</li>
<li>
<strong>OR:</strong> Use OR to broaden your search by including synonyms or related terms. For example, “social media OR social networks” will return articles that include either term.</li>
<li>
<strong>NOT:</strong> Use NOT to exclude unwanted terms. For example, “social media NOT Facebook” will exclude articles that specifically focus on Facebook.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/boolean.jpg" style="width:100.0%" alt="Boolean Operators"><div class="figcaption">Boolean Operators</div>
</div>
<p><strong>5. Read and Evaluate Search Results Carefully</strong></p>
<p>After conducting your search, take the time to review the results carefully. Pay attention to the title, abstract, and keywords of each article to determine its relevance to your research. Ensure that the articles are published in reputable journals, have undergone peer review, and are authored by credible experts in the field.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use Filters to Narrow Down Results</strong></p>
<p>Many specialized search engines provide filters that allow you to narrow down results by various criteria, such as year of publication, subject area, or type of document. For instance, if you are looking for the most recent studies on a topic, you can filter your search results to only include articles published in the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>7. Refer to Help Documentation</strong></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with a particular search engine, refer to its help documentation. These guides often include tips on using advanced search features, understanding search results, and optimizing your search queries. For example, Google Scholar’s help page provides explanations on how to refine searches, save citations, and set up alerts for new research.</p>
<p>By combining the right search engine with effective search strategies, you can efficiently find the research articles you need for your academic work.</p>

<h3>The three-pass approach.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-three-pass-approach."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The three-pass approach to reading a research paper is a method of reading a paper in three stages, each with a specific goal.</p>
<p><strong>The first pass</strong>. This is a quick scan to capture a high-level view of the paper. You should read the title, abstract, and introduction carefully, and then skim the rest of the paper, paying attention to the headings and subheadings. The goal of this pass is to get a general understanding of what the paper is about, its main points, and its contributions to the field.</p>
<p><strong>The second pass</strong>: This is a more detailed reading of the paper. You should read the introduction and conclusion carefully, and then read the rest of the paper in more detail, paying attention to the methods, results, and discussion. The goal of this pass is to understand the paper’s arguments and evidence, and to assess its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>The third pass</strong>: This is a critical reading of the paper. You should read the paper carefully, taking notes and challenging the author’s assumptions and conclusions. The goal of this pass is to fully understand the paper and to be able to critically evaluate its claims.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-question-based-approach." class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The question-based approach.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-question-based-approach."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<h3>The active reading approach.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-active-reading-approach."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Active reading is a method of reading that involves engaging with the text in a thoughtful and critical way. It is different from passive reading, which is simply reading the text without thinking about it.</p>
<p>Active reading can be used to read any type of text, but it is especially important for reading research papers. Research papers are often dense and technical, so it is important to be actively engaged in order to understand them.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for active reading:</p>
<p><strong>Ask questions</strong>: As you read, ask yourself questions about the text. What is the author’s purpose? What are the main points? What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?</p>
<p><strong>Take notes</strong>: Taking notes can help you to remember the key points of the text and to track your progress. You can take notes in the margins of the text, or you can use a separate notebook.</p>
<p><strong>Summarize</strong>: After each section of the text, summarize the key points in your own words. This will help you to solidify your understanding of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss the text with others</strong>: Talking to others about a text can help you to gain new insights and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Annotate the text</strong>: Annotating the text means making notes and comments in the margins. This can help you to highlight important passages, ask questions, and make connections between different parts of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Use a highlighter</strong>: Highlighting important passages can help you to focus your attention and to remember the key points of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Take a break</strong>: Don’t try to read a research paper in one sitting. Take breaks to refresh your mind and to come back to the text with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>Active reading takes time and effort, but it is a valuable skill for anyone who wants to learn and grow. By actively reading research papers, you can improve your comprehension, critical thinking skills, and ability to learn new things.</p>
