## Institutional Review Board (IRB)

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) plays an essential role in ensuring that research involving human participants is conducted ethically and in compliance with federal regulations and institutional policies. For students and new researchers, navigating the IRB process may initially appear complex, but it is an invaluable component of conducting responsible and credible research. Understanding the IRB's purpose, processes, and requirements will not only help you meet ethical and regulatory standards but also enhance the quality and integrity of your work.

### The Role and Principles of the IRB {.unnumbered}

The IRB is tasked with reviewing research proposals to ensure that studies involving human participants adhere to ethical principles and minimize risks. This oversight is grounded in the principles established by the Belmont Report:

1.  **Respect for Persons**: Researchers must uphold participants' autonomy and ensure informed consent. This includes providing clear, accessible information about the study's purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits.
2.  **Beneficence**: Studies must be designed to maximize benefits and minimize harm to participants, ensuring their well-being is prioritized throughout the research process.
3.  **Justice**: Researchers must ensure the equitable selection of participants, avoiding exploitation of vulnerable groups and ensuring fair distribution of risks and benefits.

### Navigating the IRB Process {.unnumbered}

Before initiating any study involving human participants, researchers must submit their project for IRB review. The process involves several key steps:

#### Step 1: Screening and Submission {.unnumbered}

Determine whether your project qualifies as human subjects research (HSR) and requires IRB approval. SIUE provides a screening tool within the Kuali electronic protocol system to help researchers make this determination. Common activities requiring IRB review include surveys, interviews, focus groups, and experiments involving human data. Even if your study may qualify for exempt status (e.g., anonymous surveys), the IRB must still review and approve the protocol.

-   **Review Timelines**:
    -   Exempt Review: 1--3 weeks
    -   Expedited Review: 3--6 weeks
    -   Full Board Review: 4--8 weeks or longer (reviewed during monthly meetings)

For full board reviews, submit your protocol at least two weeks before the second Wednesday of the month to meet the monthly meeting deadline.

#### Step 2: CITI Certification {.unnumbered}

All researchers involved in the study must complete the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) certification before IRB approval. This training ensures researchers understand ethical standards and best practices for working with human participants. Courses include:

-   **IRB Social Behavioral Student**
-   **IRB Social Behavioral Faculty**
-   **Biomedical Researcher**
-   **IRB Member**

![Dr. Leith's IRB Certification.](images/irb-cert.png){width="100%"}

CITI training provides critical insights into informed consent, confidentiality, and managing participant risks, equipping you to design ethically sound research.

#### Step 3: Preparing and Submitting Your Protocol {.unnumbered}

Log into the [Kuali Online IRB Protocol System](https://siue.kuali.co/protocols) to create and submit your protocol. Your submission should include:

-   A detailed study description outlining its purpose, methodology, and expected outcomes
-   Informed consent forms with clear, participant-friendly language
-   Recruitment materials, surveys, interview guides, or other relevant documents

![Kuali section for select exempt status.](images/kuali-exempt.png){width="100%"}

For guidance, use the available [online tutorial](https://www.siue.edu/its/training/KRProtocols/story_html5.html) and [IRB Protocol Guide](https://www.siue.edu/compliance/human-subjects/pdf/IRBProtocolGuidance.pdf). Faculty may direct students to the [SandBox Practice Site](https://siue-sbx.kuali.co/protocols) to familiarize themselves with the system before submitting a live protocol.

#### Step 4: Insurance for Student-Initiated Research {.unnumbered}

If your study is not part of a course or degree requirement, you may need to obtain research insurance. The SIU Risk Management Office provides details on [required coverage](http://siusystem.edu/risk-management/insurancereq.shtml). Proof of insurance must be submitted before protocol approval.

#### Step 5: Post-Approval Responsibilities {.unnumbered}

Once your protocol is approved, it is essential to adhere to the approved procedures and promptly report any changes, adverse events, or project completion. Use the Kuali system to:

1.  **Amend Protocols**: Submit changes to your study and await IRB approval before implementing them.
2.  **Submit Reports**: Provide annual progress reports or completion reports as instructed by the IRB.

#### Step 6: Reporting Adverse Events {.unnumbered}

Any unanticipated problems or adverse events must be reported to the IRB immediately by contacting [researchcompliance\@siue.edu](mailto:Researchcompliance@siue.edu) or calling 618-650-3010. Timely reporting ensures participant safety and compliance with federal regulations.

### Levels of IRB Review {.unnumbered}

The IRB provides three levels of review based on the risk level and study complexity:

1.  **Exempt Review**: For minimal-risk studies, such as anonymous surveys. These receive a quicker review process.
2.  **Expedited Review**: For research involving minimal risk but requiring more thorough review, such as non-anonymous interviews.
3.  **Full Board Review**: For studies involving greater risks, such as sensitive topics or vulnerable populations. These reviews are conducted during monthly meetings and require detailed scrutiny.

### Why Engage with the IRB? {.unnumbered}

While the IRB process may seem daunting, it provides several benefits:

-   **Strengthens Research Design**: IRB feedback helps refine your methodology, ensuring ethical rigor and clear protocols.
-   **Builds Ethical Awareness**: Engaging with the IRB process prepares you to conduct responsible research throughout your career.
-   **Fosters Credibility**: Ethical compliance enhances the integrity and impact of your findings, fostering trust within the academic community and beyond.
