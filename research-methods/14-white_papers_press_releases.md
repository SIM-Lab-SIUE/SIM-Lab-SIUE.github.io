# Writing a White Paper and Press Release

In mass communication, conducting research is just the beginning. Equally important is the ability to communicate your findings to audiences who can apply them—journalists, marketers, media producers, policymakers, and the public. This chapter will teach you how to translate your academic research into two highly effective forms of public communication: a **White Paper** and a **Press Release**.

You will learn how to:
- Write a professional White Paper that communicates your research findings and recommendations.
- Craft a compelling Press Release that promotes your White Paper to a broader audience.

Let’s begin by understanding the purpose and structure of each.

## Part I: Writing a White Paper

### What Is a White Paper? {.unnumbered}

A **White Paper** is a persuasive, research-backed document that identifies a problem and proposes evidence-based solutions. Unlike academic research papers, which are dense and formal, White Papers are **practical, accessible, and actionable**. They are designed for an informed but non-specialist audience—people who care about your topic but don’t have time to read a 30-page journal article.

In this project, your White Paper will present the results of a survey you designed, distributed, and analyzed during the semester.

### Structure of a White Paper {.unnumbered}

The following structure follows the roadmap in your assignment and aligns with professional expectations in media and communication industries.

#### 1. Title Page {.unnumbered}
- **Title**: Clear and engaging.
- **Include**: Your name, affiliation, and the date.
- *Example*: “Screens and Stress: How College Students Cope with Digital Overload”

#### 2. Executive Summary (≈ 1 page) {.unnumbered}
- Write this last, but place it first.
- Summarize: the problem, your findings, and your main recommendation.
- *Tip*: Use short paragraphs and bullets to improve readability.

#### 3. Introduction & Background (3–4 pages) {.unnumbered}
- Introduce the problem and explain why it matters.
- Include key literature, industry relevance, and policy debates.
- Define your scope: Who are you studying? What are you asking? Why now?

#### 4. Research Methodology (2–3 pages) {.unnumbered}
- Describe your **survey design**: What did you ask and why?
- Explain your **sample**: Who took your survey and how many responses did you get?
- Describe your **analysis process**: How did you analyze your data? (e.g., descriptive statistics, cross-tabs, coding)
- Mention any **limitations**: Did you have a small sample or potential bias?

#### 5. Key Findings & Analysis (3–4 pages) {.unnumbered}
- Present your most important findings using narrative plus visualizations (charts, graphs, or tables).
- Focus on patterns, comparisons, and meaningful takeaways.
- Don’t just dump data—interpret it!

#### 6. Implications & Recommendations (2–3 pages) {.unnumbered}
- Based on your results, what should stakeholders do?
- Address recommendations to specific audiences (e.g., campus mental health centers, TikTok content creators, student journalists).
- Offer 2–4 actionable insights, and explain their significance.

#### 7. Conclusion (≈ 2 pages) {.unnumbered}
- Remind the reader of the problem and how your research helps solve it.
- Reinforce your top recommendation.
- End with a forward-looking statement (e.g., why more research or immediate action is needed).

#### 8. References {.unnumbered}
- Use a consistent format for referencing all sources, including studies, articles, and datasets.

#### 9. Appendices (Optional) {.unnumbered}
- Include your survey instrument, full tables, or raw output here.

### Tips for Writing a White Paper {.unnumbered}

- **Tone**: Professional but plainspoken. Avoid academic jargon.
- **Navigation**: Use headings, bullet points, and visuals.
- **Design**: Use simple formatting with 11- or 12-point Times New Roman, 1" margins.
- **Visuals**: Use charts and infographics to support your claims—not just decorate the page.

## Part II: Writing the Press Release

### What Is a Press Release? {.unnumbered}

A **Press Release** is a one-page announcement meant to promote the White Paper to journalists, organizations, and the public. It briefly summarizes your findings and urges readers to learn more. The tone is accessible and energetic, but professional.

Think of it as your **elevator pitch** for the White Paper.

### Structure of a Press Release {.unnumbered}

#### 1. Headline (1 line) {.unnumbered}
- Capture attention with your key takeaway.
- *Example*: “New Study Reveals 7 in 10 Students Report Burnout from Constant Notifications”

#### 2. Subheadline (optional) {.unnumbered}
- Provide extra context or urgency.
- *Example*: “White Paper from SIUE Mass Comm Students Urges Digital Wellness Tools on Campus”

#### 3. Dateline & Lead Paragraph {.unnumbered}
- Format: *City, State – Month Day, Year*
- First sentence: The most important finding.
- Second sentence: Why it matters.
- Third sentence: Who did the research.

#### 4. Body Paragraphs (2–3 paragraphs, 3–5 sentences each) {.unnumbered}
- Paragraph 1: What issue or gap does the White Paper address?
- Paragraph 2: Key findings from the research.
- Paragraph 3: Actionable recommendations and their potential impact.

#### 5. Quote from a Lead Researcher {.unnumbered}
- *Example*: “We saw how stressed students are by endless notifications,” said Jane Doe, a senior at SIUE. “Our data shows small changes—like setting digital boundaries—can make a real difference.”

#### 6. Call to Action {.unnumbered}
- Tell people where to find or download the full paper.
- *Example*: “To read the full White Paper, visit www.siuemasscommresearch.com/studentstress”

#### 7. Boilerplate {.unnumbered}
- A short paragraph about your research team or class.
- *Example*: “This research was conducted by students in the Spring 2025 MC 451 Research Methods course at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. The class focuses on applying research to real-world media and communication problems.”

#### 8. Contact Info {.unnumbered}
- Name, title, university, email, phone.

### Final Formatting Tips {.unnumbered}

- **Length**: 1 page maximum
- **Spacing**: Single spaced, with double space between paragraphs
- **Style**: Use journalistic conventions (no indentation, AP-style punctuation, short paragraphs)
- **Tone**: Clear, concise, and newsworthy

## Conclusion: From Research to Impact

Your work this semester doesn’t end with collecting data—it ends when your findings make an impact. The **White Paper** and **Press Release** are your tools to tell that story, frame your results, and persuade others to take action.

This is research with a purpose. Now it’s your turn to share it.
